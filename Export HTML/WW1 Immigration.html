<h1 id="ww1-immigration">WW1 Immigration</h1>
<p><strong>1914</strong>, America is at it's peak of Immigration.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Woodrow Wilson.html">President Woodrow Wilson</a> urges Americans to avoid violently taking sides afraid that the different ethnicities will line up against each other. His goal is to create what he calls <strong><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/100% Americanism.html">100% Americanism</a></strong>, which he hopes will be a key factor in winning the war.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>obsidian-html error:</strong> Could not find page 100% Americanism^0fdb17.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immigrant communities were diverse in their reaction to the war, some supported their home nations while others did not.   </p>
<p><strong>German Immigrants were treated harshly</strong> :   </p>
<ul>
<li>They were considered aliens.   </li>
<li>Had to go down to police stations to get fingerprinted.   </li>
<li>Forced to carry an identification card.   </li>
<li>Were put under surveillance by the government.   </li>
<li>Banned from representing/expressing their culture.   </li>
<li>Could not teach the German Language in Schools.   </li>
<li>German newspapers were forced to cancel.   </li>
<li>Were tarred and feathered - by Mob groups.   </li>
<li>Forced to kiss Americans flags - by Mob groups.   </li>
<li>Their houses being painted yellow so that they could be easily identified and further harassed.   </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1 In Every 5</strong> soldiers in the US Armed Forces is an immigrant. Some immigrants thought that joining the Military was a path to citizenship. It was <em>believed</em> that bringing all the "Hyphenated Americans" together would make them all <em>just</em> Americans. Having immigrants in the Army was a mutual learning experience that created national unity.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2>
