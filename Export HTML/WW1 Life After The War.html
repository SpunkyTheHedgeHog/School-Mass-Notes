<p>The War was predilected to last far into <strong>1920</strong>, but unexpectedly, Germany Surrendered in <strong>1918</strong> because they could not hold off the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/WW1 Allied Powers.html">Allied Powers</a>. An Armistice was Signed, an agreement to end fighting, on <strong>November 11th, 1918</strong>.   </p>
<p>The Soldiers come home to a country that has changed. The Men who stayed home became richer and women became more independent. Women were always told that they could not do certain jobs, but when they came back home, they were shocked that women were successfully doing them. The <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Industrial Revolution.html">economic boom</a> is over and now their former jobs have been taken, meaning that the soldiers can't find work. They feel forgotten, and are mentally worn down and ill. Many experience Shell Shock/PTSD. <br />
The Soldiers did not receive any sort of check or bonus - <em>though it was promised</em> - there is no plan to reintegrate soldiers back into society, and the government was not prepared.   </p>
<p>This time transitioned into <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/The Roaring Twenties.html">The Roaring Twenties</a>   </p>
<p>The economy is in trouble, there was a revolution in Russia that is bringing a Socialist government to power. Ideas about Socialism are spreading throughout Europe. This all is generating fear that Socialism might be coming to the United States, and leads to investigations, raids, and deportations of people who opposed the government or took radical positions. The average US citizen did not benefit from the War, and was at unrest.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2>
