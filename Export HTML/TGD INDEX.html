<h3 id="in-what-year-did-the-great-depression-begin">In what year did the Great Depression begin?</h3>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a> began in <strong>1929</strong>.   </p>
<h3 id="what-was-said-to-be-the-cause-of-the-great-depression-in-america">What was said to be the cause of the Great Depression in America?</h3>
<p>The initial cause of <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a> was the borrowing of easy credit. This was the act of buying goods on money that people could not pay back, leading to both sides of the transaction would lose money. 6 million dollars of wares are purchased on money that didn't exist, and 80% of Americans lacked savings. The stocks of companies, one of the goods being purchased, are sold for 50 times the price than what they are worth, and as a result, the Stock Market loses 12 times more money in 3 weeks than the US Government uses in a year.     </p>
<p>In addition, the supply of many industries, such as farmers, are overproducing and outpacing the demand of their products, leading to waste. Since the demand of their products is way lower than what they have, bosses lay off workers. (<em>Workers being laid off now have no source of income, further slowing the demand of supplies as they can't purchase what they need</em>)    </p>
<h3 id="what-did-america-feel-that-it-had-to-do-to-recover-from-the-great-depression">What did America feel that it had to do to recover from the Great Depression?</h3>
<p>America knew that it needed to gain money and create motivation to be able to support itself and keep standing for any longer. Projects such as <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Mount Rushmore.html">Mount Rushmore</a>, Public work programs like the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/New Deal.html">New Deal</a>, and the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/The Hoover Dam.html">Hoover Dam</a> are contributed to America's <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD Recovery.html">Recovery</a>.   </p>
<h3 id="what-was-the-dust-bowl-and-what-caused-it">What was the “Dust Bowl” and what caused it?</h3>
<p>In <strong>1934</strong>, multiple duststorms hit New York, 18,000 miles wide, carrying 3 tons of dust, for every American. The storms originated in Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and Kanas. The Top soil is 4 meters deep - dried up and was loose due to the 4 years of farmers. Static electricity build up between the Earth and the Dust, and as a result, it is lifted up and is further propelled by high altitude winds.   </p>
<h3 id="what-were-the-affects-of-the-dust-bowl">What were the affects of the “Dust Bowl”?</h3>
<p>On <strong>April 13, 1935</strong>, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Louise Walter.html">Louise Walter</a> is living on the southern plains with her daughters - she has breathing problems, and 39 duststorms within 3 months have just passed. The biggest dustorm hits, going at 65 miles an hour, as it hit's Colorado, the temperature changes, and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Louise Walter.html">Louise Walter</a>'s daughters gets devoured by the sudden onslaught of dust. She is rescued by her mom, but the house it falling apart; dust is seeping through the walls, windows, and cracks of the wood house. Cattle die, being cut open by the sand. Dust Pneumonia can kill people, lungs full of dust.   </p>
<p>Automatic Street lights come on during the day.   </p>
<p>By <strong>1936</strong>, 26 billion dollars a day are lost by farmers. 250,000 farmers are fleeing the dust. Black Sunday. 2/3 of "dustbowlers" stay.   </p>
<h3 id="what-major-engineering-project-helped-to-save-the-southwest-of-america">What major engineering project helped to save the southwest of America?</h3>
<p>The construction of <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/The Hoover Dam.html">The Hoover Dam</a>.   </p>
<h3 id="how-did-this-project-help-the-southwest-and-america-what-states-did-it-mainly-benefit">How did this project help the southwest and America? What states did it mainly benefit?</h3>
<p>The water and hydroelectricity that the Dam generates off of it's <em>'a-million-and-a-half-gallon-a-second-power</em>' transforms the whole of the Southwest. Nevada, Arizona, California, still benefit from the hydroelectricity today. It's profit is directly responsible for the town of <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Las Vegas.html">Las Vegas</a>.   </p>

<h3 id="in-what-ways-was-this-creation-going-to-help-america-out-of-the-great-depression">In what ways was this creation going to help America out of the Great Depression?</h3>
<p>The Dam generates electricity, and power from the water. The electricity made can make money for the US. It's profit is directly responsible for the town of <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Las Vegas.html">Las Vegas</a>, and around <strong>1930</strong>, 5,000 people live in <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Las Vegas.html">Las Vegas</a>. The city is seen as a relaxing, fun and games (Drinking and Gambling) haven for men. Wives of men say that they deserve the haven for the hard work they have done on the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/The Hoover Dam.html">Hoover Dam</a>.   </p>
<p>In <strong>present day</strong>, over 37 million people come each year to party.   </p>

<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Joe Louis.html">Joe Louis</a> loses the fight to <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Max Schmelling.html">Max Schmelling</a>. This was inspiration for Germany, and was a publicity dream for the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Germany.html">Nazis</a>. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> says 'their mistake was freeing their slaves'. A rematch is arranged. In Germany, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Germany.html">Nazis</a> expand their power. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Joe Louis.html">Joe Louis</a> had a lot of Weight on his Shoulders. For the first time in America's history, it was symbolically represented by a black man.   </p>
<p>75 thousand people watch the fight live, 7 million people tune in via radio, 100 million people tune in via tv. The fight is a battle of ideologies, it was representing a lot more. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Max Schmelling.html">Max Schmelling</a> represented everything America disliked.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Max Schmelling.html">Schmelling</a> is knocked out and loses the fight in 124 seconds. His victory was was what America needed at the time.   </p>
<h3 id="explain-how-did-the-us-government-react-to-the-great-depression-pg-426">==Explain== How did the U.S. Government react to the Great Depression? <code>PG 426</code></h3>
<p>Before, the U.S. Government was very hands off when it dealt with the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">Great Depression</a>. But when <strong>1932</strong> came around, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Franklin Delano Roosevelt.html">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> became President. In efforts to stop <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a>, the government deployed what was called the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/New Deal.html">New Deal</a>. The <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/New Deal.html">New Deal</a> was a collection of economic and social programs established by <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Franklin Delano Roosevelt.html">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> to help Americans during <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a>.   </p>
<p>The <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/New Deal.html">New Deal</a> allowed the federal government to take a more active role in managing the economy. New laws regulated the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Stock Market.html">Stock Market</a> and protected bank deposits. Government programs created jobs and gave aid to farmers. A new Social Security system provided pensions for the elderly and other benefits.   </p>
<p>Unfortunately, The <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/New Deal.html">New Deal</a> program failed to out right end <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a> as it was planned to due to the natural disaster that was the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD Dustbowl.html">TGD Dustbowl</a>. (<em>This is not to say that the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/New Deal.html">New Deal</a> didn't help, it did, but not exactly enough</em>) <br />
<sub><sub>I guess you can say it didn't <strong><em>deal</em></strong> with the situation well enough.</sub></sub>   </p>
<p>America cancelled any and all investments to other countries, and raised their <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Tariffs.html">Tariffs</a> to try to get more money. This action affected the other countries and led them to doing the same, which rippled like a Rube Goldberg machine and just ended up hurting everyone.   </p>
<p>The Government also assisted in the funding of <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Frank Crowe.html">Frank 'hurry up' Crowe</a>'s project, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/The Hoover Dam.html">The Hoover Dam</a>, a dam that generated hydroelectricity off of the Colorado River. While it took 4 years to build, it was done ahead of their planned 6 years, and it transformed the whole of the Southwest (Nevada, Arizona, California continue to benefit from it today).   </p>
<p>To symbolize America's pride, it's unity, it's tenacity, and it's fate in it's future and past, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Mount Rushmore.html">Mount Rushmore</a> was created. It featured a bust of 4 different Presidents - and a <em>bust</em> it was when lighting struck a powerline, causing the sculpting dynamite to be set off prematurely and <em>busting</em> <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Bill Reynolds.html">Bill Reynolds</a>'s eardrums (He was back on the job the next day).</p><h2>Backlinks</h2>
