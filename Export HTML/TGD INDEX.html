<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a> began in <strong>1929</strong>    </p>
<h3 id="what-was-said-to-be-the-cause-of-the-great-depression-in-america">What was said to be the cause of the Great Depression in America?</h3>
<p>The initial cause of <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a> was the borrowing of easy credit. This was the act of buying goods on money that people could not pay back, leading to both sides of the transaction would lose money. 6 million dollars of wares are purchased on money that didn't exist, and 80% of Americans lacked savings. The stocks of companies, one of the goods being purchased, are sold for 50 times the price than what they are worth, and as a result, the Stock Market loses 12 times more money in 3 weeks than the US Government uses in a year.     </p>

<h3 id="what-was-the-dust-bowl-and-what-caused-it">What was the “Dust Bowl” and what caused it?</h3>
<p>In <strong>1934</strong>, multiple duststorms hit New York, 18,000 miles wide, carrying 3 tons of dust, for every American. The storms originated in Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and Kanas. The Top soil is 4 meters deep - dried up and was loose due to the 4 years of farmers. Static electricity build up between the Earth and the Dust, and as a result, it is lifted up and is further propelled by high altitude winds.   </p>
<h3 id="what-were-the-affects-of-the-dust-bowl">What were the affects of the “Dust Bowl”?</h3>
<p>On <strong>April 13, 1935</strong>, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Louise Walter.html">Louise Walter</a> is living on the southern plains with her daughters - she has breathing problems, and 39 duststorms within 3 months have just passed. The biggest dustorm hits, going at 65 miles an hour, as it hit's Colorado, the temperature changes, and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Louise Walter.html">Louise Walter</a>'s daughters gets devoured by the sudden onslaught of dust. She is rescued by her mom, but the house it falling apart; dust is seeping through the walls, windows, and cracks of the wood house. Cattle die, being cut open by the sand. Dust Pneumonia can kill people, lungs full of dust.   </p>
<p>Automatic Street lights come on during the day.   </p>
<p>By <strong>1936</strong>, 26 billion dollars a day are lost by farmers. 250,000 farmers are fleeing the dust. Black Sunday. 2/3 of "dustbowlers" stay.   </p>

<p>The water and hydroelectricity that the Dam generates off of it's <em>'a-million-and-a-half-gallon-a-second-power</em>' transforms the whole of the Southwest. Nevada, Arizona, California, still benefit from the hydroelectricity today.
