<p>In <strong>1934</strong>, multiple duststorms hit New York, 18,000 miles wide, carrying 3 tons of dust, for every American. The storms originated in Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and Kanas. The Top soil is 4 meters deep - dried up and was loose due to the 4 years of farmers. Static electricity build up between the Earth and the Dust, and as a result, it is lifted up and is further propelled by high altitude winds.   </p>
<h3 id="what-were-the-affects-of-the-dust-bowl">What were the affects of the “Dust Bowl”?</h3>
<p>On <strong>April 13, 1935</strong>, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Louise Walter.html">Louise Walter</a> is living on the southern plains with her daughters - she has breathing problems, and 39 duststorms within 3 months have just passed. The biggest dustorm hits, going at 65 miles an hour, as it hit's Colorado, the temperature changes, and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Louise Walter.html">Louise Walter</a>'s daughters gets devoured by the sudden onsluaght of dust. She is rescued by her mom, but the house it falling apart; dust is seeping through the walls, windows, and cracks of the wood house. Cattle die, being cut open by the sand. Dust Pneumonia can kill people, lungs full of dust.   </p>
<p>By <strong>1936</strong>, 26 billion dollars a day are lost by farmers. 250,000 farmers are fleeing the dust. Black Sunday. 2/3 of "dustbowlers" stay.   </p>

<p>In attempt to recover, America started to try it's best help itself out and relaim at least some of what it lost. After losing above 6 million dollars, the public funded a vast amount of building projects that were privatly built, one of them included <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/The Hoover Dam.html">The Hoover Dam</a>, built over the Colorado river. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/The Hoover Dam.html">The Hoover Dam</a>, named after <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Herbert Hoover.html">Herbert Hoover</a> represented America regaining it's balance.

<p>Even before it was built, it was seen as a metaphor   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/The Hoover Dam.html">The Hoover Dam</a> would cost 1 million dollars to build. <br />
Frank would receive a 2.5% cut of the Dam's profit.    </p>
