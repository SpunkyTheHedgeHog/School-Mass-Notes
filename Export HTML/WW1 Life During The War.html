<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Militarism.html">Militarism</a> was a key part in getting people motivated for the War and keeping moral high. Instances of Militarism such as making people feel like losers for not joining the Military and flexing of Weaponry all contributed to the War.   </p>
<p>America stayed neutral to the War, and engaged in trade with Europe. (This later caused Britain and other countries to be in dept.)   </p>
<h1 id="100-americanism">100% Americanism</h1>
<p><strong>100% Americanism</strong> was the notion that immigrants had to renounce any sort of ties to their homelands; political ties, cultural ties, economic ties to be considered 100% loyal. 100% National Unity,   </p>
<p>The idea was to create a <strong>collective American identity</strong> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americanism_(ideology))   </p>
<p>People changed the name of Hamburgers to Liberty Sandwiches.</p>
<p>America was considering joining the war because Germany sunk the Lusitania (a trade ship). Germany was sinking out ships because America was bringing supplies to the Allied forces. While America did warn Germany to stop sinking their ships, Germany decided it would be a better option to stop the trade.   </p>
<p>Citizens were encouraged to use less meat and wheat, and instead use ingredients like fish, beans, and corn.   </p>
<h4 id="womens-contribution-to-the-war">Women's Contribution to the War</h4>
<p>During the War, Women took on the role of Patriotic mothers, and were the reason that men were fighting. Because so many jobs became vacant, women filled the spots and had to do work that they have never done before.   </p>
<p>Women were encouraged to use less meat (<em>Meat was 'meant' to go to the soldiers</em>) and wheat, and instead use fish, beans, and corn. In addition to wrapping red cross bandages for free (Unpaid Labor, They were Volunteers). <strong>Women heavily contributed in terms of the military effort</strong> through nursing. Women gained a lot of respect and admiration for serving as this role.   </p>
<p>Rosie the Riveter -   </p>
<p>Women took on many jobs that were considered very Masculine: Moving Ammunition, Meat packing Industry, and Jobs requiring heavy machinery. Before the War, it was seen as an abomination for a Woman to being these jobs. This was changing where women found the workplace, meaning that women did not look for jobs that were considered masculine up until the war in which women were now taking interest in these jobs.   </p>
<p>Women also were taking jobs such as: Typists, Telephone Operators (Signal Corp), Civilian Contractors.   </p>
<p>Women are working in the Navy as "Yeoman (F)", but later was changed to "Yeomanette", they didn't serve on board ships but from home. They took on positions that 'freed' a man to go and serve in the military. Women wore uniforms, sashes, and badges that showed Authority.   </p>
<p><strong>This as a whole changed people's view on Women</strong>. In <strong>1920</strong>, there was a Federal Amendment that granted all Women the right to vote.    </p>
<p>There were a limited number of <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/WW1 YMCA.html">YMCA</a> workers, people who read to the men, who served them in hospitality.   </p>
<p>This was the first time that Women were considered formal members of the Armed Services. Expectations of Women changed, and Women gained respect. Women became more Independent. Women were always told that they could not do certain jobs, but when they came back home, they were shocked that women were successfully doing them.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2>
