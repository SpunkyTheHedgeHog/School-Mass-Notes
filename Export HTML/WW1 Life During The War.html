<h1 id="ww1-life-during-the-war">WW1 Life During The War</h1>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Militarism.html">Militarism</a> was a key part in getting people motivated for the War and keeping moral high. Instances of Militarism such as making people feel like losers for not joining the Military and flexing of Weaponry all contributed to the War.   </p>
<h4 id="womens-contribution-to-the-war">Women's Contribution to the War</h4>
<p>Women are bringing their own paychecks, and are showing interest in the right to vote.   </p>
<p>During the War, Women took on the role of Patriotic mothers, and were the reason that men were fighting. Because so many jobs became vacant, women filled the spots and had to do work that they have never done before.   </p>
<p>Women were encouraged to use less meat (<em>Meat was 'meant' to go to the soldiers</em>), and to wrap red cross bandages for free (Unpaid Labor). <strong>Women heavily contributed in terms of the military effort</strong> through nursing. Women gained a lot of respect and admiration for serving as this role.   </p>
<p>Women are working in the Navy as "Yeoman (F)", but later was changed to "Yeomanette", they didn't serve on board ships but from home. They took on positions that 'freed' a man to go and serve in the military. Women wore uniforms, sashes, and badges that showed Authority.   </p>
<p><strong>This as a whole changed people's view on Women</strong>. In <strong>1920</strong>, there was a Federal Amendment that granted all Women the right to vote.   </p>
<p>There were a limited number of <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/WW1 YMCA.html">YMCA</a> workers, people who read to the men, who served them in hospitality.   </p>
<p>Women became more Independent. Women were always told that they could not do certain jobs, but when they came back home, they were shocked that women were successfully doing them.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2>
