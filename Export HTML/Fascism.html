                                <h1 id="fascism">Fascism</h1>
<h2 id="book-information">Book Information</h2>
<p>Historians still debate the real nature of Mussolini’s fascist ideology. Mussolini coined the term, but fascists had no unifying theory as Marxists did. Today, we generally use the term fascism to describe any centralized, authoritarian government that is not <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">communist</a> whose policies glorify the state over the individual and are destructive to basic human rights. In the 1920s and 1930s, though, fascism meant different things in different countries.   </p>
<h3 id="features-of-fascism">Features of Fascism</h3>
<p>All forms of fascism, however, shared some basic features. They were rooted in extreme nationalism. Fascists glorified action, violence, discipline, and, above all, blind loyalty to the state.   </p>
<p>Fascists also pursued aggressive foreign expansion. Echoing the idea of “survival of the fittest,” Fascist leaders glorified warfare as a noble struggle for survival. “<em>War alone,</em>” declared Mussolini, “<em>brings to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon peoples who have the courage to face it.</em>”   </p>
<p>Fascists were also antidemocratic. They rejected the Enlightenment emphasis on reason and the concepts of equality and liberty. To them, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">democracy</a> led to corruption and weakness. They claimed <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">democracy</a> put individual or class interests above national goals and destroyed feelings of community. Instead, fascists emphasized emotion and the need for individuals to serve the state.   </p>
<h3 id="the-appeal-of-fascism">The Appeal of Fascism</h3>
<p>Given its restrictions on individual freedom, why did fascism appeal to many Italians? First, it promised a strong, stable government and an end to the political feuding that had paralyzed <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">democracy</a> in Italy. Mussolini projected a sense of power and confidence at a time of disorder and despair. His intense nationalism also revived national pride, which helped further the shift of political thought throughout Italy.   </p>
<p>At first, Il Duce received good press outside Italy. Newspapers in Britain, France, and North America applauded the discipline and order of Mussolini’s government. “He got the trains running on time,” admirers said. Only later, when Mussolini embarked on a course of foreign conquest, did Western democracies protest.   </p>
<h2 id="fascism-vs-communism">Fascism vs Communism</h2>
<p>In Russia, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> was favored for it's purposed benefits to the working and middle class, but in Italy, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a> was favored for it's extreme national goals and motivations.   </p>
<p>While both ideologies drew people in out of fear and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Propaganda.html">Propaganda</a>, they were vastly different options to the people. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> promised unity, featured a classes society, where everyone collectively owned their wealth and property as a whole. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a>, pledged to create a strong and stable government, so long as it could divide people into classes and demand the blind loyalty of it's followers in the government.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> finds support of it's ideologies in the working class, while <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a> generates interest among business leaders, higher ups, the government, and middle class families who hoped to get bumped up the higher class. However, both philosophies included a small group of '<em>elites</em>' who were meant to control the situation, but took matters into their own hands and usually ruled like a/an oligarchy/monarchy.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2>
