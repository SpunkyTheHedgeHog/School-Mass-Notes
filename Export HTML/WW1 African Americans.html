        <h1 id="ww1-african-americans">WW1 African Americans</h1>
<p>At the time of entering the War, African-Americans are largely living in rural areas. Slavery has ended but <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Jim Crow.html">Jim Crow</a> has replaced it.   </p>
<p>There are African-American women who want to be nurses and go abroad, and work in the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/WW1 YMCA.html">WW1 YMCA</a> abroad <strong>Inquiry</strong> but are not allowed to.   </p>
<h4 id="african-american-women">African American Women</h4>
<p>Women who worked overseas were mainly Upper-Class, affluent (not poor people basically), and were able to be supported by their families. <strong>There were no opportunities for Black Women Overseas</strong>, They were not allowed to   </p>
<ul>
<li>be nurses   </li>
<li>telephone operators   </li>
<li>ambulance drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>The War creates both obligations and opportunities. Everyone is asked to conserve food, buy bonds, and support the war effort. <strong>African-Americans raised an estimate of $250 million in <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">war bonds</a>.</strong>   </p>
<p>It was heavily debated if African-Americans should participate in the Military. Many were given labor intensive jobs in dangerous areas without proper defenses. One of the worst jobs were the <strong>Graves Registration Service</strong> - In which men had to disinter the bodies of the fallen soldiers.   </p>
<h1 id="ww1-harlem-hellfighters">WW1 Harlem Hellfighters</h1>
<p><strong>Main Points</strong> :   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Helped establish to the entire world the power of black soldiers in the military   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Units (People in the Military) of African American descent didn't know what they were going to be tasked with, but were trained to do anything. <strong>Pershing</strong>, a General of the American Army, didn't want to give France any reinforcements, but since he had less respect for African-American units, he transfers them instead.   </p>
<p><strong>Hennery Johnson</strong>, a Unit assigned to a listening post in <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/No Man's Land.html">No Man's Land</a>. During a silent raid from the German forces, Hennery Johnson Jammed his American Gun with a French Cartridge, and as a result had to use his rifle like a blunt object and a knife to defend himself and others against Keizer's Best. He succeeded in his efforts and fended off what could have been 30 German Soldiers.    </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Hennery Johnson didn't receive the Metal of Merit for another 75 years, and when coming back home from the war, was treated like he did nothing, he got no money, nor medal, and died in <strong>1929</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="ww1-red-summer">WW1 Red Summer</h1>
<p>During <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/WW1 INDEX.html">WW1</a>, it was the height of <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/White Supremacy.html">White Supremacy</a>. White Americans were intent in ensuring that black people remembered their subordinate place in society and were willing to use violence to make that clear. In <strong>1919</strong>, there were racial riots during the Summer in which blood was spilled - which is where the name <em>Red Summer</em> comes from.   </p>
<p>Many riots in the past had been massacres, but this time black people took a stand. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/W.E.B Du Bois.html">W.E.B Du Bois</a>, goes to Europe to interview African-American troops, and learns a lot; He says <code>"We Return from Fighting. We Return Fighting"</code>.</p>{_obsidian_html_backlinks_pattern_:WW1 African Americans}
