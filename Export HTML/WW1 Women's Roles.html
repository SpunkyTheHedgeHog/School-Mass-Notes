<p>Women are bringing their own paychecks, and are showing interest in the right to vote.   </p>
<p>During the War, Women took on the role of Patriotic mothers, and were the reason that men were fighting. Because so many jobs became vacant, women filled the spots and had to do work that they have never done before.   </p>
<p>Women were encouraged to use less meat (<em>Meat was 'meant' to go to the soldiers</em>), and to wrap red cross bandages for free (Unpaid Labor). ==Women heavily contributed in terms of the military effort== through nursing. Women gained a lot of respect and admiration for serving as this role.   </p>
<p>Women are working in the Navy as "Yeoman (F)", but later was changed to "Yeomanette", they didn't serve on board ships but from home. They took on positions that 'freed' a man to go and serve in the military. Women wore uniforms, sashes, and badges that showed Authority.   </p>
