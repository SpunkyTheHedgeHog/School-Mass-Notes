<h1 id="tgd-recovery">TGD Recovery</h1>
<p>In attempt to recover, America started to try it's best to help itself out and reclaim at least some of what it lost. After losing above 6 million dollars, the public funded a vast amount of building projects that were privately built, one of them included 1 million dollar, 4 year project that was <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/The Hoover Dam.html">The Hoover Dam</a>, built over the Colorado river.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/The Hoover Dam.html">The Hoover Dam</a>, named after <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Herbert Hoover.html">Herbert Hoover</a>, represented America regaining it's balance, fortitude, ingenuity, and talent hard work. It was built by head engineer <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Frank Crowe.html">Frank Crowe</a>, who gained the nicknamed <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Frank Crowe.html">Frank 'hurry up' Crowe</a> for their efficiency at building Dams. <strong>By March 4th, 1931</strong>, the government gives the go-ahead to start construction, allowing <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Frank Crowe.html">Mr. Crowe</a> to have 2.5% of the Dam's profit.    </p>
<p>42,000 men flock to Colorado in attempt to secure a job, many using up all - if any - of their savings that they had left to travel. Unfortunately, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Frank Crowe.html">Frank Crowe</a> only accepts 12% (5,000) of the men; It was survival of the fittest, known as <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Social Darwinism.html">Social Darwinism</a>. As an incentive to pursue, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Frank Crowe.html">Frank Crowe</a> receives a $3,000 find each day the project falls behind schedule. The workers had to endure rough conditions, such as 140 degree heat, and Carbon monoxide poisoning coming from the drills. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Frank Crowe.html">Frank Crowe</a> didn't exactly motivate the workers either, stating (that his one rule was) :   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>To hell with excuses - get results</em>" - <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Frank Crowe.html">Frank Crowe</a>   </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Erma Godbey.html">Erma Godbey</a>, a miner's wife, recites a story about a miner who was so anxious to work, that he went into the drill site to clear rubble, and was killed due to a delayed blast of dynamite that he was not aware of. It is estimated that hundreds of men died in the project, but the company only confirms 96.   </p>
<p>Despite many odds and challenges, such as the cooling of the cement, and Carbon Monoxide gases, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/The Hoover Dam.html">The Hoover Dam</a> was completed on <strong>September 30th, 1935</strong>, 2 years ahead of Schedule.   </p>
<p>The water and hydroelectricity that the Dam generates off of it's <em>'a-million-and-a-half-gallon-a-second-power</em>' transforms the whole of the Southwest. Nevada, Arizona, California, still benefit from the hydroelectricity today. It's profit is directly responsible for the town of <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Las Vegas.html">Las Vegas</a>.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2>
