<h3 id="analyze-maps-according-to-the-map-on-page-469-where-were-the-death-camps-located-how-did-these-locations-reflect-the-goals-of-the-final-solution">==Analyze Maps== According to the map on page <code>469</code>, where were the death camps located? How did these locations reflect the goals of the "Final Solution"</h3>
<p>All the death camps were located towards the center of Poland. The majority of Jewish people lived in Poland, so it would make sense to build the camps close by. Surrounding Poland were many work camps, in which after Germany was done with forcing manual labor of Jewish people, they would transfer them over to the death camps.   </p>
<h3 id="synthesize-describe-the-escalation-of-hitlers-campaign-against-the-jews-pg-470">==Synthesize== Describe the escalation of Hitler's campaign against the Jews. <code>Pg 470</code></h3>
<p>Hitler started out hating the Jews and using them as Scapegoats for the country's problems, by the end of his campaign it had escalated to 6 million killed by <strong>1945</strong>. Hitler created labor camps around Europe for Jewish people to do suffer in, and when the German force didn't need a person's labor any longer, they were sent to Death camps like Auschwitz in which they were gassed and cremated.   </p>
<p>In addition, cruel and inhuman experiments were acted upon death camp victims.   </p>

<p>The Jewish people created a secret resistance to combat German officers from taking over territory, deporting citizens, and sending Jews to camps. Jewish people fled to underground homes, and secret living spaces within homes. The alliance that was created in Warsaw armed themselves with smuggled weapons and improvise explosives.   </p>
<h3 id="draw-conclusion-why-were-soviet-and-american-forces-finally-able-to-liberate-many-concertation-camp-victims">==Draw Conclusion== Why were Soviet and American forces finally able to liberate many concertation camp victims.</h3>
<p>America and Soviet forces became aware of the death camps before the Nazi's could purge the evidence of their "Final Solution". The Germans saw that their assaults were not working and that they were losing the war. At the concertation camps they had minimal protection, and lost easily.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2>
