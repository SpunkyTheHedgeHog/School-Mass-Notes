<p>The Axis powers were Italy Germany and Japan.   </p>

<h3 id="describe-describe-how-the-axis-powers-gained-control-of-most-of-europe-in-1941-pg-465">==DESCRIBE== Describe how the Axis powers gained control of most of Europe in 1941. <code>PG 465</code></h3>
<p>The Axis Powers first acted out what was called Operation Sea Lion, a series of blitzes in which German Military Air Support bombed military bases and cities (like London) in Europe. While Operation Sea Lion didn't out right bring Europe to it's knees - as what <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> hoped; as people were still attempting to carry on with their standard routine, it assisted in the second plan of the Axis Powers.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a>'s "New Order" was the plan to put light-skinned Europeans (known as the Aryan Masterace) in the offices of puppet governments <strong>Inquiry,</strong> and to achieve this plan, he [most likely] used military blitzkrieg tactics causing devastating impacts with tanks and air. The land that they gained provided valuable economic resources and provided money to support <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a>'s vision.   </p>
<p>To suppress any uprising of rebels, German officers and military would often boss around and torture anyone and everyone.   </p>
<h3 id="identify-supporting-details-why-did-hitler-nullify-the-nazi-soviet-pact-by-invading-the-soviet-union-pg-466">==IDENTIFY SUPPORTING DETAILS== Why did Hitler nullify the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Nazi Germany.html">Nazi</a>-Soviet Pact by invading the Soviet Union <code>PG 466</code></h3>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> voided the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Nazi-Soviet Pact.html">Nazi-Soviet Pact</a>, which was to keep piece between the Soviet-Union and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Nazi Germany.html">Nazi</a>-Germany and dividing up any land that they had conquered. He did so by attempting to take control of Leningrad and it' factories, resources, and food. In addition to the resources, he would also gain more living space for his "Masterace". The effort was suffered due to the unaccounted for winter, in which many German soldiers died of the starvation and the -18c temperature.   </p>
<h3 id="analyze-maps-how-might-this-new-enemy-affect-germanys-war-effort-in-geographical-terms-pg-466">==ANALYZE MAPS== How might this new enemy affect Germanys war effort in geographical terms? <code>PG 466</code></h3>
<p>Germany created a new enemy, Russia, after violating the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/History/Nazi Germany.html">Nazi</a>-Soviet pact. This hurt Germany's defenses as they now needed to spread out their military across the areas under Axis control as well as North-East border between Russia's territory and German's.   </p>
<h3 id="identify-central-ideas-why-did-japanese-leaders-view-the-united-states-as-an-enemy-pg-467">==IDENTIFY CENTRAL IDEAS== Why did Japanese leaders view the United States as an enemy? <code>PG 467</code></h3>
<p>While the Europeans were distracted by the growing war, Japan saw the opportunity and advanced into French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies in <strong>1940</strong>. In response to the advancement, the US banned the sale of war materials such as iron, steel, and oil to Japan. Japanese leaders saw this a threat to their economy and it's "<em>Asian sphere of influence</em>".</p><h2>Backlinks</h2>
