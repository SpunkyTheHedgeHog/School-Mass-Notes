<h2 id="fascism-vs-communism">Fascism vs Communism</h2>
<p>In Russia, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> was favored for it's purposed benefits to the working and middle class, but in Italy, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a> was favored for it's extreme <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nationalism.html">national</a> goals and motivations.   </p>
<p>While both ideologies drew people in out of fear and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Propaganda.html">Propaganda</a>, they were vastly different options to the people. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> promised unity, featured a classes society, where everyone collectively owned their wealth and property as a whole. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a>, pledged to create a strong and stable government, so long as it could divide people into classes and demand the blind loyalty of it's followers in the government.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> finds support of it's ideologies in the working class, while <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a> generates interest among business leaders, higher ups, the government, and middle class families who hoped to get bumped up the higher class. However, both philosophies included a small group of '<em>elites</em>' who were meant to control the situation, but took matters into their own hands and usually ruled like a/an oligarchy/monarchy.</p>
<h3 id="support-ideas-with-examples-describe-the-problems-of-the-weimar-republic-pg-440">==Support Ideas With Examples== Describe the problems of the Weimar Republic. <code>PG 440</code></h3>
<h2 id="problems-with-the-weimar-republic">Problems with the Weimar Republic</h2>
<p>The Weimar Republic faced political extremists, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Hyperinflation.html">Hyperinflation</a>, and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a>.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communists</a> demanded radical changes like those Lenin had brought to Russia. Conservatives including the old Junker nobility, military officers, and wealthy bourgeoisie attacked the government as too liberal and weak.   </p>
<p>Economic disaster fed unrest. The Weimar Republic was poor, and couldn't make enough money to consistently help themselves, which led to crime. France occupied the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Ruhr Valley.html">Ruhr Valley</a>, and thus had it's coal, letting them generate mass amounts of energy and money from their newly obtained iron, steel, and coal industries.   </p>
<p>People were against the new government, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascists</a> felt that the government was weak. People were divided into small parties, who were fighting for how they think it the government should be run, everyone had their own mentality.  Extremists would fight and kill government people, many 'factions' of the government were disagreeing and also fighting each other.</p>
<h3 id="describe-the-ideology-of-hitler-and-the-nazi-party-pg-441">Describe the Ideology of Hitler and the Nazi Party. <code>PG 441</code></h3>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> wrote a book while in prison due to failed attempt to seize power about his obsessions of racism, extreme <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nationalism.html">Nationalism</a>, and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Anti-Semitism.html">Anti-Semitism</a>. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> believed that Germans belonged to a superior "master race" or Aryans, of light-skinned Europeans, whose greatest enemies were Jews.   </p>
<p>The rise of <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nationalism.html">Nationalism</a> caused people to identify Jews as outsiders. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> identified a Jew as anyone with at least one Jewish parent, he considered them as not one as members of a religion but as a separate race.   </p>
<h3 id="how-did-the-nazi-party-maintain-its-control-of-germany">How did the Nazi Party maintain it's control of Germany?</h3>
<p>In short, lots of appealing to the People and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Propaganda.html">Propaganda</a>. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> organized an efficient and brutal system of terror, repression and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Totalitarian.html">Totalitarian</a> rule.    </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a> only helped fuel the bonfire, and gave people another reason to join the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Party.html">Nazi Party</a> as unemployment rates started flatting on the '<em>y axis</em>'. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> made Jobs available - this gave people pride (<em><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Propaganda.html">Propaganda</a> shamed men who didn't have jobs</em>). The jobs that <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> gave were jobs that helped build the country, brought business, brought labor, and maintained capital (all under control off the government).    </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a>'s ideology gave veterans, workers, lower-middle class, average folk, and business men a <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Scapegoat.html">Scapegoat</a>, aka someone to blame for their problems, and supported them by promising to end reparations, create jobs, and defy the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Versailles Treaty.html">Versailles Treaty</a> by Rearming Germany.    </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/The Weimar Republic.html">The Weimar Republic</a>'s nation was divided and was <em>being held together by scotch tape</em>. It looked for someone who could deal with the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Germany.html">Nazis</a> and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communists</a>, and while it was a good option by no means, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> was the option they picked, and they appointed him <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Chancellor.html">Chancellor</a> in <strong>1933</strong>. While <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> gained rule by legal means, he ruled as a <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Dictator.html">Dictator</a>, killing anyone and everyone he deemed as disloyal. He quickly minimized small political parties, and eradicated/eliminated his rival party, the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communists</a>.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> caused further fear in citizens by publicly killing them in unjust and cruel ways. One of the "<em>calmer</em>" of the methods was that the police would bring the person outside their home, shoot them, and leave their body on the street. This acted as a method of intimidation, and ensued terror.   </p>
<h3 id="identify-central-issues-how-did-world-war-1-impact-the-growth-of-authoritarian-states-in-eastern-europe-pg-444">==Identify Central Issues== How did World War 1 impact the growth of authoritarian states in Eastern Europe? <code>PG 444</code></h3>
<p>Like Germany, most new nations in went from <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Democracy.html">Democratic</a> to <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Authoritarian.html">Authoritarian</a> rule in the postwar era. Although they did have their differences, none of them had enough money to develop their Industry, in addition, none of them wanted to help each other develop either due to ethnic rivalries left over from <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/WW1 INDEX.html">WW1</a>.   </p>
<p>This led to each country attempting to be independent of it's neighbors, and severe tension. In Czechoslovakia, Czechs and Slovaks became unwilling partners and some German people showed interest in joining the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Party.html">Nazi Party</a>.   </p>
<h3 id="analyze-politcal-cartoons-british-cartoonist-david-low-was-known-for-speaking-out-against-the-policy-of-appeasement-how-does-this-cartoon-reflect-him-message-pg-457">==Analyze Politcal Cartoons== British cartoonist David Low was known for speaking out against the policy of appeasement. How does this cartoon reflect him message? <code>PG 457</code></h3>
<p><img alt="" src="/School-Mass-Notes/Export%20HTML/Images/NaziComic.png" /> <br />
The message that the author of the comic is conveying is that by <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Appeasement.html">appeasing</a> to <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a>'s demands, the Western Democracies were letting the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Party.html">Nazi Party</a> quote on quote, "Walk all over them". The text over the people, "Spineless Leaders of Democracy", goes to show that the author disapproves of the lack of action of the leaders.   </p>
<p>The pose of the man Nazi Man (I can't tell if it is <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a>) is taunting, and shows that 'walking up the steps' is an ease, further reflecting the author's message.   </p>
<h3 id="recall-describe-the-early-acts-of-aggression-of-germany-italy-and-japan-pg-458-lesson-71">==Recall== Describe the early acts of aggression of Germany, Italy, and Japan. <code>PG 458 : Lesson 7.1</code></h3>
<p>Japan's military leaders and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Ultranationalists.html">Ultranationalists</a> wanted to achieve the level of power that of Western states had, and in means of acquiring that power, Japan overran the Chinese province of Manchuria in <strong>1931</strong>. 4 years later, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Mussolini.html">Mussolini</a> commanded Italy to invade Ethiopia (Located in northeastern Africa), and with use of poison gas, airplanes, machine guns, and tanks, Mussolini was successful in his <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Imperialism.html">Imperialist</a> ambitions (<strong>1936</strong>). Back in Germany, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> violates the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Versailles Treaty.html">Versailles Treaty</a>, and builds up Germany's military , in addition to stationing soldiers in the demilitarized Rhineland bordering France. <br />
<strong>Inquiry</strong> <code>When the Axis Powers form, was the public and other Goverments made aware, or was it done in secret?</code>   </p>
<h3 id="recall-explain-how-other-countries-got-involved-in-the-spanish-civil-war-pg-459">==Recall== Explain how other countries got involved in the Spanish Civil War. <code>PG 459</code></h3>
<p>The Spanish Ware featured two sides, The Nationalists, and the Loyalists. Depending on if you supported <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a>, and/or supported <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a>, you were persuaded to pick for what side you felt was right. This got entire countries wrapped up in the War.   </p>
<h3 id="check-understanding-how-did-hitler-justify-taking-over-austria-and-the-sudetenland-pg-461">==Check Understanding== How did Hitler Justify taking over Austria and the Sudetenland? <code>PG 461</code></h3>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">Adolf Hitelr</a> justified his actions of taking over Austria and the Sudetenland by saying that it was his "right" to "remove millions of an inferior race". He was also was compelled to take over these areas beacuse he could use the natural reasources to strengthen the Nazi Army, in addition to selling goods to make a profit.     </p>
<h3 id="identify-central-ideas-why-did-britain-and-france-end-their-policy-of-appeasement-pg-461">==Identify Central Ideas== Why did Britain and France end their policy of appeasement? <code>PG 461</code></h3>
<p>The goal of the policy was to avoid war and conflict with Germany, however, after Britian and France decided that Germany was contuining to create complications, they decided that their strategy wansn't working.    </p>
<h3 id="analyze-maps-in-viewing-the-map-on-page-463-how-did-germany-violate-the-treaty-of-versailles">==Analyze Maps== In viewing the map on <code>page 463</code>, How did Germany violate the Treaty of Versailles?</h3>
<p>The map shows that Germany expandedd their territory into the prevoiusly unmilitarized area. This violated the Treaty of Verailles. Now owning this area, Germany is closer to France and Belgium   </p>
