<h3 id="compare-points-of-view-describe-the-similarities-between-fascism-and-communism-pg-430">==Compare Points Of View== Describe the similarities between fascism and communism. <code>PG 430</code></h3>
<h2 id="fascism-vs-communism">Fascism vs Communism</h2>
<p>In Russia, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> was favored for it's purposed benefits to the working and middle class, but in Italy, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a> was favored for it's extreme <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nationalism.html">national</a> goals and motivations.   </p>
<p>While both ideologies drew people in out of fear and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Propaganda.html">Propaganda</a>, they were vastly different options to the people. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> promised unity, featured a classes society, where everyone collectively owned their wealth and property as a whole. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a>, pledged to create a strong and stable government, so long as it could divide people into classes and demand the blind loyalty of it's followers in the government.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> finds support of it's ideologies in the working class, while <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a> generates interest among business leaders, higher ups, the government, and middle class families who hoped to get bumped up the higher class. However, both philosophies included a small group of '<em>elites</em>' who were meant to control the situation, but took matters into their own hands and usually ruled like a/an oligarchy/monarchy.</p>
<h3 id="support-ideas-with-examples-describe-the-problems-of-the-weimar-republic-pg-440">==Support Ideas With Examples== Describe the problems of the Weimar Republic. <code>PG 440</code></h3>
<h2 id="problems-with-the-weimar-republic">Problems with the Weimar Republic</h2>
<p>The Weimar Republic faced political extremists, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Hyperinflation.html">Hyperinflation</a>, and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a>.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communists</a> demanded radical changes like those Lenin had brought to Russia. Conservatives including the old Junker nobility, military officers, and wealthy bourgeoisie attacked the government as too liberal and weak.   </p>
<p>Economic disaster fed unrest. The Weimar Republic was poor, and couldn't make enough money to consistently help themselves, which led to crime. France occupied the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Ruhr Valley.html">Ruhr Valley</a>, and thus had it's coal, letting them generate mass amounts of energy and money from their newly obtained iron, steel, and coal industries.   </p>
<p>People were against the new government, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascists</a> felt that the government was weak. People were divided into small parties, who were fighting for how they think it the government should be run, everyone had their own mentality.  Extremists would fight and kill government people, many 'factions' of the government were disagreeing and also fighting each other.</p>
<h3 id="describe-the-ideology-of-hitler-and-the-nazi-party-pg-441">Describe the Ideology of Hitler and the Nazi Party. <code>PG 441</code></h3>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> wrote a book while in prison due to failed attempt to seize power about his obsessions of racism, extreme <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">nationalism</a>, and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">anti-Semitism</a>. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> believed that Germans belonged to a superior "master race" or Aryans, of light-skinned Europeans, whose greatest enemies were Jews.   </p>
<p>The rise of <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nationalism.html">Nationalism</a> caused people to identify Jews as outsiders. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> identified a Jew as anyone with at least one Jewish parent, he considered them as not one as members of a religion but as a separate race.   </p>
<h3 id="how-did-the-nazi-party-maintain-its-control-of-germany">How did the Nazi Party maintain it's control of Germany?</h3>
<p>In short, lots of appealing to the People and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Propaganda.html">Propaganda</a>. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> organized an efficient and brutal system of terror, repression and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">totalitarian</a> rule.    </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a> only helped fuel the bonfire, and gave people another reason to join the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Party.html">Nazi Party</a> as unemployment rates started flatting on the '<em>y axis</em>'. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> made Jobs available - this gave people pride (<em><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/not_created.html" class="nonexistent-link">propaganda</a> shamed men who didn't have jobs</em>). The jobs that <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> gave were jobs that helped build the country, brought business, brought labor, and maintained capital (all under control off the government).    </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a>'s ideology gave veterans, workers, lower-middle class, average folk, and business men a <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Scapegoat.html">Scapegoat</a>, aka someone to blame for their problems, and supported them by promising to end reparations, create jobs, and defy the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Versailles Treaty.html">Versailles Treaty</a> by Rearming Germany.    </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/The Weimar Republic.html">The Weimar Republic</a>'s nation was divided and was <em>being held together by scotch tape</em>. It looked for someone who could deal with the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Germany.html">Nazis</a> and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communists</a>, and while it was a good option by no means, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> was the option they picked, and they appointed him <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Chancellor.html">Chancellor</a> in <strong>1933</strong>. While <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> gained rule by legal means, he ruled as a <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Dictator.html">Dictator</a>, killing anyone and everyone he deemed as disloyal. He quickly minimized small political parties, and eradicated/eliminated his rival party, the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communists</a>.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> caused further fear in citizens by publicly killing them in unjust and cruel ways. One of the "<em>calmer</em>" of the methods was that the police would bring the person outside their home, shoot them, and leave their body on the street. This acted as a method of intimidation, and ensued terror.   </p>
<h3 id="how-did-world-war-1-impact-the-growth-of-authoritarian-states-in-eastern-europe">How did World War 1 impact the growth of authoritarian states in Eastern Europe?</h3>
<p>PG 442, A <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Totalitarian.html">Totalitarian</a> State Emerges   </p>
<p>Like Germany, most new nations in went from <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Democracy.html">Democratic</a> to <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Authoritarian.html">Authoritarian</a> rule in the postwar era. Although they did have their differences, none of them had enough money to develop their Industry, in addition, none of them wanted to help each other develop either due to ethnic rivalries left over from <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/WW1 INDEX.html">WW1</a>.   </p>
<p>This led to each country attempting to be independent of it's neighbors, and severe tension. In Czechoslovakia, Czechs and Slovaks became unwilling partners and some German people showed interest in joining the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Party.html">Nazi Party</a>.   </p>
