<h3 id="compare-points-of-view-describe-the-similarities-between-fascism-and-communism-pg-430">==Compare Points Of View== Describe the similarities between fascism and communism. <code>PG 430</code></h3>
<h2 id="fascism-vs-communism">Fascism vs Communism</h2>
<p>In Russia, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> was favored for it's purposed benefits to the working and middle class, but in Italy, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a> was favored for it's extreme national goals and motivations.   </p>
<p>While both ideologies drew people in out of fear and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Propaganda.html">Propaganda</a>, they were vastly different options to the people. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> promised unity, featured a classes society, where everyone collectively owned their wealth and property as a whole. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a>, pledged to create a strong and stable government, so long as it could divide people into classes and demand the blind loyalty of it's followers in the government.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> finds support of it's ideologies in the working class, while <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a> generates interest among business leaders, higher ups, the government, and middle class families who hoped to get bumped up the higher class. However, both philosophies included a small group of '<em>elites</em>' who were meant to control the situation, but took matters into their own hands and usually ruled like a/an oligarchy/monarchy.</p>
<h3 id="support-ideas-with-examples-describe-the-problems-of-the-weimar-republic-pg-440">==Support Ideas With Examples== Describe the problems of the Weimar Republic. <code>PG 440</code></h3>
<h1 id="the-weimar-republic">The Weimar Republic</h1>
<p>The Weimar Republic faced political extremists, extreme inflation, and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a>.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communists</a> demanded radical changes like those Lenin had brought to Russia. Conservatives including the old Junker nobility, military officers, and wealthy bourgeoisie attacked the government as too liberal and weak.   </p>
<p>Economic disaster fed unrest. The Weimar Republic was poor, and couldn't make enough money to consistently help themselves, which led to crime. France occupied the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Ruhr Valley.html">Ruhr Valley</a>, and thus had it's coal, letting them generate mass amounts of energy and money from their newly obtained iron, steel, and coal industries.   </p>
<p>People were against the new government, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascists</a> felt that the government was weak. People were divided into small parties, who were fighting for how they think it the government should be run, everyone had their own mentality.</p>
<h3 id="describe-the-ideology-of-hitler-and-the-nazi-party-pg-441">Describe the Ideology of Hitler and the Nazi Party. <code>PG 441</code></h3>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> wrote a book while in prison due to failed attempt to seize power about his obsessions of racism, extreme nationalism, and anti-Semitism. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> believed that Germans belonged to a superior "master race" or Aryans, of light-skinned Europeans, whose greatest enemies were Jews.   </p>
<p>The rise of nationalism caused people to identify Jews as outsiders. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> identified a Jew as anyone with at least one Jewish parent, he considered them as not one as members of a religion but as a separate race.   </p>
<h3 id="how-did-the-nazi-party-maintain-its-control-of-germany">How did the Nazi Party maintain it's control of Germany?</h3>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> organized an efficient and brutal system of terror, repression and totalitarian rule. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a> only helped fuel the bonfire, an gave people another reason to join the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Party.html">Nazi Party</a> as unemployment rates started flatting on the '<em>y axis</em>'.    </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a>'s ideology gave veterans, workers, lower-middle class, average folk, and business men a <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Scapegoat.html">Scapegoat</a> , aka someone to blame for their problems, and supported them by promising to end reparations, create jobs, and defy the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Versailles Treaty.html">Versailles Treaty</a> by Rearming Germany.    </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/The Weimar Republic.html">The Weimar Republic</a>'s nation was divided and was <em>being held together by scotch tape</em>. It looked for someone who could deal with the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Germany.html">Nazis</a> and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communists</a>, and while it was a good option by no means, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> was the option they picked, and they appointed him <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Chancellor.html">Chancellor</a> in <strong>1933</strong>. While <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a> gained rule by legal means, he ruled as a dictator, killing anyone and everyone he deemed as disloyal. He quickly minimized small political parties, and eradicated/eliminated his rival party, the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communists</a>.   </p>
