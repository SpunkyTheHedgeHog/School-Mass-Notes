</blockquote>
<p>Units (People in the Military) of African American descent didn't know what they were going to be tasked with, but were trained to do anything. <strong>Pershing</strong>, a General of the American Army, didn't want to give France any reinforcements, but since he had less respect for African-American units, he transfers them instead ^5972a7   </p>
<p><strong>Hennery Johnson</strong>, a Unit assigned to a listening post in <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/No Man's Land.html">No Man's Land</a>. During a silent raid from the German forces, Hennery Johnson Jammed his American Gun with a French Cartridge, and as a result had to use his rifle like a blunt object and a knife to defend himself and others against Keizer's Best. He succeeded in his efforts and fended off what could have been 30 German Soldiers.    </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Hennery Johnson didn't receive the Metal of Merit for another 75 years, and when coming back home from the war, was treated like he did nothing, he got no money, nor medal, and died in <strong>1929</strong>.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2>
