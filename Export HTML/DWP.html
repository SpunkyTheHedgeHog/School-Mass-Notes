<h2 id="problems-with-the-weimar-republic">Problems with the Weimar Republic</h2>
<p>The Weimar Republic faced political extremists, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Hyperinflation.html">Hyperinflation</a>, and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/TGD INDEX.html">The Great Depression</a>.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communists</a> demanded radical changes like those Lenin had brought to Russia. Conservatives including the old Junker nobility, military officers, and wealthy bourgeoisie attacked the government as too liberal and weak.   </p>
<p>Economic disaster fed unrest. The Weimar Republic was poor, and couldn't make enough money to consistently help themselves, which led to crime. France occupied the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Ruhr Valley.html">Ruhr Valley</a>, and thus had it's coal, letting them generate mass amounts of energy and money from their newly obtained iron, steel, and coal industries.   </p>
<p>People were against the new government, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascists</a> felt that the government was weak. People were divided into small parties, who were fighting for how they think it the government should be run, everyone had their own mentality.  Extremists would fight and kill government people, many 'factions' of the government were disagreeing and also fighting each other.</p>

<h3 id="fascism-vs-communism">Fascism vs Communism</h3>
<p>In Russia, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> was favored for it's purposed benefits to the working and middle class, but in Italy, <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a> was favored for it's extreme <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nationalism.html">national</a> goals and motivations.   </p>
<p>While both ideologies drew people in out of fear and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Propaganda.html">Propaganda</a>, they were vastly different options to the people. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> promised unity, featured a classes society, where everyone collectively owned their wealth and property as a whole. <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a>, pledged to create a strong and stable government, so long as it could divide people into classes and demand the blind loyalty of it's followers in the government.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Communism.html">Communism</a> finds support of it's ideologies in the working class, while <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Fascism.html">Fascism</a> generates interest among business leaders, higher ups, the government, and middle class families who hoped to get bumped up the higher class. However, both philosophies included a small group of '<em>elites</em>' who were meant to control the situation, but took matters into their own hands and usually ruled like a/an oligarchy/monarchy.</p>

<p>The Axis Powers first acted out what was called Operation Sea Lion, a series of blitzes in which German Military Air Support bombed military bases and cities (like London) in Europe. While Operation Sea Lion didn't out right bring Europe to it's knees - as what <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> hoped; as people were still attempting to carry on with their standard routine, it assisted in the second plan of the Axis Powers.   </p>
<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Hitler</a>'s "New Order" was the plan to put light-skinned Europeans (known as the Aryan Masterace) in the offices of puppet governments <strong>Inquiry,</strong> and to achieve this plan, he [most likely] used military blitzkrieg tactics causing devastating impacts with tanks and air. The land that they gained provided valuable economic resources and provided money to support <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a>'s vision.   </p>
<p>To suppress any uprising of rebels, German officers and military would often boss around and torture anyone and everyone.   </p>

<p><a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Adolf Hitler.html">Adolf Hitler</a> voided the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi-Soviet Pact.html">Nazi-Soviet Pact</a>, which was to keep piece between the Soviet-Union and <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Germany.html">Nazi</a>-Germany and dividing up any land that they had conquered. He did so by attempting to take control of Leningrad and it' factories, resources, and food. In addition to the reasources, he would also gain more living space for his "masterrace". The effort was suffered due to the unaccounted for winter, in which many German soldiers died of the starvation and the -18c temperature.   </p>

<p>Germany created a new enemy, Russia, after violating the <a href="/School-Mass-Notes/Export HTML/Nazi Germany.html">Nazi</a>-Soviet pact. This hurt Germany's defenses as they now needed to spread out their military across the areas under Axis control as well as North-East border between Russia's territory and German's.   </p>

<p>The Japanese leaders viewed the US as an enemey because The US cut them off from selling resources after Japan has been conquering areas.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2>
