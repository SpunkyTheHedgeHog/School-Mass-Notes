# WW1 Preparing For War
When The United States adopted the Draft, it opened up for Conscientious Objection, in which someone who is drafted tells the government that they cannot serve for religious or other reasons. 

65,000 men claimed conscientious objection, and for it received bullying, physical violence, and in some cases prosecution. They were considered a danger to the War effort.

Laws were made to make it illegal to criticize the government or the war effort. People who objected went to prison, received a record, and were released after the end of the War - but the consequences could last long after.
