### ==Analyze Maps== According to the map on page `469`, where were the death camps located? How did these locations refelct the goals of the "Final Solution"
All the death camps were located towards the center of Poland. The majority of Jewish people lived in Poland, so it would make sense to build the camps close by. Surrounding Poland were many work camps, in which after Germany was done with forcing manual labor of Jewish people, they would transfer them over to the death camps.
### ==Synthesize== Describe the escalation of Hitler's campaign against the Jews. `Pg 470`
Hitler started out hating the Jews and using them as Scapegoats for the country's problems, by the end of his campaing it had escalted to 6 million killed by **1945**. Hitler created labor camps around Europe for Jewish people to do suffer in, and when the German force didn't need a person's labor any longer, they were sent to Death camps like Auschwitz in which they were gassed and cremated.
### ==Infer== Explain why the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto decided to fight back. `Pg 471`
The Jewish people created a secret resistance to combat German officers from taking over territory, deporting citizens, and sending Jews to camps. Jewish people fled to underground homes, and secret living spaces within homes. The alliacnce that was created in Warsaw armed themselves with smuggled weapons and imporvised explosives.
### ==Draw Conclusion== Why were Soviet and American forces finally ableto liberate many concetration camp victims.
