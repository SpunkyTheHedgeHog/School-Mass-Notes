# New Deal
**1932**, in efforts to stop [[TGD INDEX|The Great Depression]], the government deployed what was called the [[New Deal]]. The [[New Deal]] was a massive package of economic and social programs established by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] to help Americans during [[TGD INDEX|The Great Depression]].

The [[New Deal]] allowed the federal government to take a more active role in managing the economy. New laws regulated the stock market and protected bank deposits. Government programs created jobs and gave aid to farmers. A new Social Security system provided pensions for the elderly and other benefits.

Unfortunately, The [[New Deal]] program failed to out right end [[TGD INDEX|The Great Depression]] as it was planned to due to the natural disaster that was the [[TGD Dustbowl]]. (*This is not to say that the [[New Deal]] didn't help, it did, but not exactly enough*)
