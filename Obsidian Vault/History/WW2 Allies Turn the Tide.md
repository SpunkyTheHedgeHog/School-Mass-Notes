# Allies Turn the Tide

## ==Identify/Central Issues== What changes did the Allies make at home to ensure that they had sufficient resources for fighting WW2? `PG 477`
They halted most of the normal America manufacturing factories. Shifting from regular factories such refrigerators and and cars were turned into tank and airplane factories, and clothing companies worked on making uniforms.

The government limited certain rights of the citizens. They censored the press to stop negative comments and thoughts on the war, and used propaganda to win public support. In the US and Canada, due to the racial prejudice and concerns of people of Japanese descent, Japanese people were confined to camps in which conditions were poor.

Women assisted where they were allowed, such as ambulance/medical services, and constructing ships and machines alike. 
## ==Draw Conclusions== What was the impact of the Battles of Coral Sea and Midway? `PG 479`
The Allies were able to use 250 planes to take out multiple (4) aircraft carriers. This crippled their abilities to launch offensives. Japan lost the ability to fight back. The fight of the Coral Sea lasted for a total of 5 days in **May 1942**.
## ==Explain== How did the Allied advance toward Germany limit that country's ability to wager war? `PG 481`
After freeing France, the Allied forces chipped away towards Germany. The Allied forces bombed military bases, factories, railroads, oil, depots, and cities. They killed 135,000 people, and enforced round-the-clock bombing. This disabled the movement of supplies, and prevented the creation of resources. Germany was being bombed 24/7, and it destroyed the moral of it's civilians.
