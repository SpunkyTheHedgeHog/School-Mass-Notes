## Problems with the Weimar Republic
The Weimar Republic faced political extremists, [[Hyperinflation]], and [[TGD INDEX|The Great Depression]].

[[Communism|Communists]] demanded radical changes like those Lenin had brought to Russia. Conservatives including the old Junker nobility, military officers, and wealthy bourgeoisie attacked the government as too liberal and weak.

Economic disaster fed unrest. The Weimar Republic was poor, and couldn't make enough money to consistently help themselves, which led to crime. France occupied the [[Ruhr Valley]], and thus had it's coal, letting them generate mass amounts of energy and money from their newly obtained iron, steel, and coal industries.

People were against the new government, [[Fascism|Fascists]] felt that the government was weak. People were divided into small parties, who were fighting for how they think it the government should be run, everyone had their own mentality.  Extremists would fight and kill government people, many 'factions' of the government were disagreeing and also fighting each other.
