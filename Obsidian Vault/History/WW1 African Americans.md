# WW1 African Americans
At the time of entering the War, African-Americans are largely living in rural areas. Slavery has ended but [[Jim Crow]] has replaced it.

There are African-American women who want to be nurses and go abroad, and work in the [[WW1 YMCA]] abroad #Inquiry but are not allowed to.

The War creates both obligations and opportunities. Everyone is asked to conserve food, buy bonds, and support the war effort. **African-Americans raised an estimate of $250 million in [[war bonds]].**

It was heavily debated if African-Americans should participate in the Military. Many were given labor intensive jobs in dangerous areas without proper defenses. One of the worst jobs were the **Graves Registration Service** - In which men had to disinter the bodies of the fallen soldiers.
