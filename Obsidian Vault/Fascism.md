`The following text is coppied straight out of the text book`

Historians still debate the real nature of Mussolini’s fascist ideology. Mussolini coined the term, but fascists had no unifying theory as Marxists did. Today, we generally use the term fascism to describe any centralized, authoritarian government that is not [[Communism|communist]] whose policies glorify the state over the individual and are destructive to basic human rights. In the 1920s and 1930s, though, fascism meant different things in different countries.
## Features of Fascism
All forms of fascism, however, shared some basic features. They were rooted in extreme nationalism. Fascists glorified action, violence, discipline, and, above all, blind loyalty to the state.

Fascists also pursued aggressive foreign expansion. Echoing the idea of “survival of the fittest,” Fascist leaders glorified warfare as a noble struggle for survival. “War alone,” declared Mussolini, “brings to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon peoples who have the courage to face it.”

Fascists were also antidemocratic. They rejected the Enlightenment emphasis on reason and the concepts of equality and liberty. To them, [[democracy]] led to corruption and weakness. They claimed [[democracy]] put individual or class interests above national goals and destroyed feelings of community. Instead, fascists emphasized emotion and the need for individuals to serve the state.
## The Appeal of Fascism
Given its restrictions on individual freedom, why did fascism appeal to many Italians? First, it promised a strong, stable government and an end to the political feuding that had paralyzed [[democracy]] in Italy. Mussolini projected a sense of power and confidence at a time of disorder and despair. His intense nationalism also revived national pride, which helped further the shift of political thought throughout Italy.

At first, Il Duce received good press outside Italy. Newspapers in Britain, France, and North America applauded the discipline and order of Mussolini’s government. “He got the trains running on time,” admirers said. Only later, when Mussolini embarked on a course of foreign conquest, did Western democracies protest.
