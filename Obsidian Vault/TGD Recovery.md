Vast building projects - Publicly funded privately built #Inquiry `Yes, but what does that mean?`

[[Frank Crowe|Frank 'hurry up' Crowe]] built a damn over the Colorado river, called [[The Hoover Dam]], named after [[Herbert Hoover]]

The water and hydroelectricity will transform the whole of the Southwest.
Nevada, Arizona, California, still benefit from the hydroelectricity today.

**March 4th, 1931** : The government gives the go-ahead to build [[The Hoover Dam]]

Even before it was built, it was seen as a metaphor

[[The Hoover Dam]] would cost 1 million dollars to build.
Frank would receive a 2.5% cut of the Dam's profit. 

42,000 men come across the country looking for jobs.

[[Frank Crowe]] takes 5,000 men out of the 42,000 people who spent 'maybe' the majority of their savings to travel.

It was survival of the fittest, known as [[Social Darwinism]]
