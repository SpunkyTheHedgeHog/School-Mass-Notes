# TGD Recovery
In attempt to recover, America started to try it's best to help itself out and reclaim at least some of what it lost. After losing above 6 million dollars, the public funded a vast amount of building projects that were privately built, one of them included 1 million dollar, 4 year project that was [[The Hoover Dam]], built over the Colorado river.

[[The Hoover Dam]], named after [[Herbert Hoover]], represented America regaining it's balance, fortitude, ingenuity, and talent hard work. It was built by head engineer [[Frank Crowe]], who gained the nicknamed [[Frank Crowe|Frank 'hurry up' Crowe]] for their efficiency at building Dams. **By March 4th, 1931**, the government gives the go-ahead to start construction, allowing [[Frank Crowe|Mr. Crowe]] to have 2.5% of the Dam's profit. 

42,000 men flock to Colorado in attempt to secure a job, many using up all - if any - of their savings that they had left to travel. Unfortunately, [[Frank Crowe]] only accepts 12% (5,000) of the men; It was survival of the fittest, known as [[Social Darwinism]]. As an incentive to pursue, [[Frank Crowe]] receives a $3,000 find each day the project falls behind schedule. The workers had to endure rough conditions, such as 140 degree heat, and Carbon monoxide poisoning coming from the drills. [[Frank Crowe]] didn't exactly motivate the workers either, stating (that his one rule was) :

>"*To hell with excuses - get results*" - [[Frank Crowe]]

[[Erma Godbey]], a miner's wife, recites a story about a miner who was so anxious to work, that he went into the drill site to clear rubble, and was killed due to a delayed blast of dynamite that he was not aware of. It is estimated that hundreds of men died in the project, but the company only confirms 96.

Despite many odds and challenges, such as the cooling of the cement, and Carbon Monoxide gases, [[The Hoover Dam]] was completed on **September 30th, 1935**, 2 years ahead of Schedule.

The water and hydroelectricity that the Dam generates off of it's *'a-million-and-a-half-gallon-a-second-power*' transforms the whole of the Southwest. Nevada, Arizona, California, still benefit from the hydroelectricity today. It's profit is directly responsible for the town of [[Las Vegas]].
