# WW1 Life Before The War
Before the War, America was peaceful; America had recovered from the civil war, the reconstruction era, and was coming into the civil rights era. The [[Industrial Revolution]] allowed America to gain an economic boost and thus America enjoyed a long period of peace. Yet, it was the height of [[White Supremacy]] because America was changing socially - African American people were finding opportunities to work, but many White Supremacists did not want this shift in social structure.
