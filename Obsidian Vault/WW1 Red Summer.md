# WW1 Red Summer
During [[WW1 INDEX|WW1]], it was the height of [[White Supremacy]]. White Americans were intent in ensuring that black people remembered their subordinate place in society and were willing to use violence to make that clear. In **1919**, there were racial riots during the Summer in which blood was spilled - which is where the name *Red Summer* comes from.

Many riots in the past had been massacres, but this time black people took a stand. [[W.E.B Du Bois]], goes to Europe to interview African-American troops, and learns a lot; He says `"We Return from Fighting. We Return Fighting"`.
