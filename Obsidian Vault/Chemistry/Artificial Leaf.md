# Artificial Leaf
## Basis
Artificial Leaf is a synthetic device that is created to imitate the function of a natural leaf. In most cases, the goal of an artificial leaf is to mimic photosynthesis, and split hydrogen and oxygen in water. The Artificial Leaf has gotten us closer to being able to produce hydrogen energy in a non-pollutive way.[^1]
## History
The first prototype was designed in 2011 by the team led by **Daniel G. Nocera**, an inorganic chemist. His believed that his invention would allow homes and villages in Africa and India to purchase a power system that was kickstarted by his and his team's work.[^2]

**Daniel G. Nocera** mentions that while he uses new technology for the time, that the Artificial Leaf isn't anything new, and **John A. Turner** did a similar feat a decade back with his creation of what he called :
>"A Monolithic Photovoltaic-Photoelectrochemical Device for Hydrogen Production via Water Splitting"[^3]

Really rolls of the tongue... However, while **Turner's** version did work, it was optimized, nor was it efficient - proved by it's lengthy lifespan of a single day. In addition, it used pricey and unideal metals like Ruthenium, which very much ironically, is vulnerable to oxidization, as noted in the book "*Chemistry of Precious Metals*".[^4]

Even before this time however - all the way back in **1912** - while he didn't make any advancements towards the idea of an Artificial Leaf, **Giacomo Ciamican** was the one who first proposed a theoretical movement from "*fossil fuels to radiant energy*"[^6]. [^5]  
## How does It work
For context, it is important to know what an Artificial Leaf is trying to achieve. In short, the goal is to take light from a source such as the sun, and use that energy to split water, i.e. H<sub>2</sub>O, into it's separate Molecules, that being Oxygen, and Hydrogen. In addition, it is important to know how usual photosynthesis works so you can understand what needs to be mimicked.

Natural Photosynthesis works in 3 to 4 steps. Step one is the Initial light-harvesting process and local charge separation, in which a ordered array of pigments absorbs light and converts it into chemical energy via the storage of **ATP** (standing for Adenosine 5'-triphosphate)[^7]. Step two is the Proton-Coupled electron transfer between redox cofactors, which is a really long and convoluted way of saying "allowing the stored chemical electricity to be capable of oxidizing water."[^8] [^5]. And the third and final step, is Homogeneous multielectron photocatalysis, which is another fancy term for splitting the water into it's components. (H<sub>2</sub>O -> H<sub>2</sub> + O)

There is an optional 4th step, which is providing extra energy from the form of an alterative light harvesting method, and using that extra energy to carry out a 3rd task that can range from more hydrogen production to CO<sub>2</sub> fixation - though, this all is depending on the plant - which is why this step is optional.

There are multiple versions of the Artificial Leaf, or more precisely, Artificial Photosynthesis. The one that I will be focusing on is ~~not only~~ the most common ~~but also the most easiest to explain~~.

This method of mimicking photosynthesis involves using a 3 set of organic compounds called amino acids to work as an assembly line - each carrying out a step from the aforementioned process. [^6]

The amino acid labeled P works as a photosensitizer (Step 1), this is linked to the organic compound labeled D, which functions as the water oxidation catalyst (Step 2) and the Homogeneous multielectron photocatalysis (Step 3). Both of these are linked to the compound labeled A, which is the optional Step 4 in this scenario.

There are different photosensitizers that can be used to substitute for the chlorophylls. One of them being the previously mentioned **Ruthenium**.

**Ruthenium**, as you might infer, is a metal, and while it works, it certainly isn't ideal by any means. A non-metal approach such as **Eosin Y** and **Rose Bengal** can also be used and much more fits the idea of an Artificial Leaf.
## Use cases
While it is quite obvious, the main use case of creating an Artificial leaf to so it can be used as a form of renewable electricity without creating the pollution that other engery producers create like coal.
## How does it compete with other ways of producing energy?
