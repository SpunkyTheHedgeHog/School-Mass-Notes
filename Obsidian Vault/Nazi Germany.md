### Describe the Ideology of Hitler and the Nazi Party. `PG 441`
[[Adolf Hitler]] wrote a book while in prison due to failed attempt to seize power about his obsessions of racism, extreme [[Nationalism]], and [[Anti-Semitism]]. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] believed that Germans belonged to a superior "master race" or Aryans, of light-skinned Europeans, whose greatest enemies were Jews.

The rise of [[Nationalism]] caused people to identify Jews as outsiders. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] identified a Jew as anyone with at least one Jewish parent, he considered them as not one as members of a religion but as a separate race.
### How did the Nazi Party maintain it's control of Germany?
In short, lots of appealing to the People and [[Propaganda]]. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] organized an efficient and brutal system of terror, repression and [[Totalitarian]] rule. 

[[TGD INDEX|The Great Depression]] only helped fuel the bonfire, and gave people another reason to join the [[Nazi Party]] as unemployment rates started flatting on the '*y axis*'. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] made Jobs available - this gave people pride (*[[Propaganda]] shamed men who didn't have jobs*). The jobs that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] gave were jobs that helped build the country, brought business, brought labor, and maintained capital (all under control off the government). 

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s ideology gave veterans, workers, lower-middle class, average folk, and business men a [[Scapegoat]], aka someone to blame for their problems, and supported them by promising to end reparations, create jobs, and defy the [[Versailles Treaty]] by Rearming Germany. 

[[The Weimar Republic]]'s nation was divided and was *being held together by scotch tape*. It looked for someone who could deal with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and [[Communism|Communists]], and while it was a good option by no means, [[Adolf Hitler]] was the option they picked, and they appointed him [[Chancellor]] in **1933**. While [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] gained rule by legal means, he ruled as a [[Dictator]], killing anyone and everyone he deemed as disloyal. He quickly minimized small political parties, and eradicated/eliminated his rival party, the [[Communism|Communists]].

[[Adolf Hitler]] caused further fear in citizens by publicly killing them in unjust and cruel ways. One of the "*calmer*" of the methods was that the police would bring the person outside their home, shoot them, and leave their body on the street. This acted as a method of intimidation, and ensued terror.
### How did World War 1 impact the growth of authoritarian states in Eastern Europe?
PG 442, A [[Totalitarian]] State Emerges

Like Germany, most new nations in went from [[Democracy|Democratic]] to [[Authoritarian]] rule in the postwar era. Although they did have their differences, none of them had enough money to develop their Industry, in addition, none of them wanted to help each other develop either due to ethnic rivalries left over from [[WW1 INDEX|WW1]].

This led to each country attempting to be independent of it's neighbors, and severe tension. In Czechoslovakia, Czechs and Slovaks became unwilling partners and some German people showed interest in joining the [[Nazi Party]].
