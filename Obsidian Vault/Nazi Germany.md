### Describe the Ideology of Hitler and the Nazi Party. `PG 441`
[[Adolf Hitler]] wrote a book while in prison due to failed attempt to seize power about his obsessions of racism, extreme [[Nationalism]], and [[Anti-Semitism]]. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] believed that Germans belonged to a superior "master race" or Aryans, of light-skinned Europeans, whose greatest enemies were Jews.

The rise of [[Nationalism]] caused people to identify Jews as outsiders. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] identified a Jew as anyone with at least one Jewish parent, he considered them as not one as members of a religion but as a separate race.

He blamed everything on Jewish people, Marxists, and corrupt politicans. (Corrupt politicans did not do good for the people of the country)
### How did the Nazi Party maintain it's control of Germany?
In short, lots of appealing to the People and [[Propaganda]]. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] organized an efficient and brutal system of terror, repression and [[Totalitarian]] rule. 

[[TGD INDEX|The Great Depression]] only helped fuel the bonfire, and gave people another reason to join the [[Nazi Party]] as unemployment rates started flatting on the '*y axis*'. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] made Jobs available - this gave people pride (*[[Propaganda]] shamed men who didn't have jobs*). The jobs that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] gave were jobs that helped build the country, brought business, brought labor, and maintained capital (all under control off the government); this was called social programs/public work programs. 

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s ideology gave veterans, workers, lower-middle class, average folk, and business men a [[Scapegoat]], aka someone to blame for their problems, and supported them by promising to end reparations, create jobs, and defy the [[Versailles Treaty]] by Rearming Germany. 

[[The Weimar Republic]]'s nation was divided and was *being held together by scotch tape*. It looked for someone who could deal with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and [[Communism|Communists]], and while it was a good option by no means, [[Adolf Hitler]] was the option they picked, and they appointed him [[Chancellor]] in **1933**. While [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] gained rule by legal means, he ruled as a [[Dictator]], killing anyone and everyone he deemed as disloyal. He quickly minimized small political parties, and eradicated/eliminated his rival party, the [[Communism|Communists]].

[[Adolf Hitler]] caused further fear in citizens by publicly killing them in unjust and cruel ways. One of the "*calmer*" of the methods was that the police would bring the person outside their home, shoot them, and leave their body on the street. This acted as a method of intimidation, and ensued terror.
### ==Identify Central Issues== How did World War 1 impact the growth of authoritarian states in Eastern Europe? `PG 444`
Like Germany, most new nations in went from [[Democracy|Democratic]] to [[Authoritarian]] rule in the postwar era. Although they did have their differences, none of them had enough money to develop their Industry, in addition, none of them wanted to help each other develop either due to ethnic rivalries left over from [[WW1 INDEX|WW1]].

This led to each country attempting to be independent of it's neighbors, and severe tension. In Czechoslovakia, Czechs and Slovaks became unwilling partners and some German people showed interest in joining the [[Nazi Party]].
### ==Analyze Politcal Cartoons== British cartoonist David Low was known for speaking out against the policy of [[appeasement]]. How does this cartoon reflect him message? `PG 457`
![[NaziComic.png]]
The message that the author of the comic is conveying is that by [[Appeasement|appeasing]] to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s demands, the Western Democracies were letting the [[Nazi Party]] quote on quote, "Walk all over them". The text over the people, "Spineless Leaders of [[Democracy]]", goes to show that the author disapproves of the lack of action of the leaders.

The pose of the man Nazi Man (I can't tell if it is [[Adolf Hitler]]) is taunting, and shows that 'walking up the steps' is an ease, further reflecting the author's message.
### ==Recall== Describe the early acts of aggression of Germany, Italy, and Japan. `PG 458 : Lesson 7.1`
Japan's military leaders and [[Ultranationalists]] wanted to achieve the level of power that of Western states had, and in means of acquiring that power, Japan overran the Chinese province of Manchuria in **1931**. 4 years later, [[Mussolini]] commanded Italy to invade Ethiopia (Located in northeastern Africa), and with use of poison gas, airplanes, machine guns, and tanks, [[Mussolini]] was successful in his [[Imperialism|Imperialist]] ambitions (**1936**). Back in Germany, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] violates the [[Versailles Treaty]], and builds up Germany's military , in addition to stationing soldiers in the demilitarized Rhineland bordering France.

### ==Recall== Explain how other countries got involved in the Spanish Civil War. `PG 459`
The Spanish War featured two sides, The Nationalists, and the Loyalists. Depending on if you supported [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s ideologies, or supported [[Communism]], you were persuaded to pick for what side you felt was right. While some counties were staying neutral at the time - Britain, France, and the US - citizens from said counties fought with the Loyalists, and thus got their countries wrapped up. The Soviet Union arranged soldiers to fight [[Fascism]] alongside the Loyalists as well. 
### ==Check Understanding== How did Hitler Justify taking over Austria and the Sudetenland? `PG 461`
[[Adolf Hitler]] justified his actions of taking over Austria and the Sudetenland by saying that it was his "right" to "remove millions of an inferior race" (and that they were like vermin). He was also was compelled to take over these areas because he could use the natural resources to strengthen the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] Army, in addition to selling goods to make a profit. The area of Third Riech would also create a living space for the [[Nazi Party]]. 
### ==Identify Central Ideas== Why did Britain and France end their policy of appeasement? `PG 461`
The goal of the policy was to avoid war and conflict with Germany, however, after Britain and France decided that Germany was containing to create complications, they decided that their strategy wasn't working. 
### ==Analyze Maps== In viewing the map on `page 463`, How did Germany violate the Treaty of Versailles?
The map shows that Germany expanded their territory into the previously unmilitarized area. This violated the Treaty of Versailles. Now owning this area, Germany is closer to France and Belgium. This was [[Adolf Hitler]]'s first time challendging the Versailles Treaty.
