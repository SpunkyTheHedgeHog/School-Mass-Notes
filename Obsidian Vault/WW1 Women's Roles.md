# WW1 Women's Roles
Women's Roles are changing a lot during the War - **1920** -, Women are not only wanting but are showing their Independence. This was the height of time for the change of Gender Roles, something that we are still experiencing today. Because of WW1, the **rate of change was accelerated**.

Women are bringing their own paychecks, and are showing interest in the right to vote.

#### Women's Contribution to the War
During the War, Women took on the role of Patriotic mothers, and were the reason that men were fighting. Because so many jobs became vacant, women filled the spots and had to do work that they have never done before.

Women were encouraged to use less meat (*Meat was 'meant' to go to the soldiers*) and wheat, and instead use fish, beans, and corn. In addition to wrapping red cross bandages for free (Unpaid Labor, They were Volunteers). **Women heavily contributed in terms of the military effort** through nursing. Women gained a lot of respect and admiration for serving as this role.

Rosie the Riveter -

Women took on many jobs that were considered very Masculine: Moving Ammunition, Meat packing Industry, and Jobs requiring heavy machinery. Before the War, it was seen as an abomination for a Woman to being these jobs. This was changing where women found the workplace, meaning that women did not look for jobs that were considered masculine up until the war in which women were now taking interest in these jobs.

Women also were taking jobs such as: Typists, Telephone Operators (Signal Corp), Civilian Contractors.

Women are working in the Navy as "Yeoman (F)", but later was changed to "Yeomanette", they didn't serve on board ships but from home. They took on positions that 'freed' a man to go and serve in the military. Women wore uniforms, sashes, and badges that showed Authority.

**This as a whole changed people's view on Women**. In **1920**, there was a Federal Amendment that granted all Women the right to vote. 

There were a limited number of [[WW1 YMCA|YMCA]] workers, people who read to the men, who served them in hospitality.

This was the first time that Women were considered formal members of the Armed Services. Expectations of Women changed, and Women gained respect. Women became more Independent. Women were always told that they could not do certain jobs, but when they came back home, they were shocked that women were successfully doing them.
