# Pacifism
Pacifism is the opposition to war or violence as a means of settling disputes.


### Pacifism in World War 1
It is the peak time for the global peace movement. Many of these Pacifists are motivated by religious sensibilites or secular reasons (anything outside of religion). some are motivated by [[Feminism]] and believed that war was a masculine undertaking - something that women could stop. Some people are motivated by economic changes.

War has always been in the interest government, not the people.
