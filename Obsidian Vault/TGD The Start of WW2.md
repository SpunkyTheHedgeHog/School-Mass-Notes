In the Heavy Weight championship, 57 million people listen in to the fight between [[Joe Louis]] and [[Max Schmelling]], and German opponent.

[[Joe Louis]]'s family was drove out of their home by the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and he keeps his family alive by boxing. 

Boxing is a symbol of [[Totalitarianism]] against [[Democracy]]. Supremacy against a nonracial kind of society.

[[Joe Louis]] loses the fight to [[Max Schmelling]]. This was inspiration for Germany, and was a publicity dream for the Nazis. Hitler says 'their mistake was freeing their slaves'. A rematch is arranged. In Germany, Nazis expand their power. [[Joe Louis]] had a lot of Weight on his Shoulders. For the first time in America's history, it was symbolically represented by a black man.
