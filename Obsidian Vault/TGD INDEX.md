## Questions, Answers, and Summaries
### In what year did the Great Depression begin?
[[TGD INDEX|The Great Depression]] began in **1929**.
### What was said to be the cause of the Great Depression in America?
The initial cause of [[TGD INDEX|The Great Depression]] was the borrowing of easy credit. This was the act of buying goods on money that people could not pay back, leading to both sides of the transaction would lose money. 6 million dollars of wares are purchased on money that didn't exist, and 80% of Americans lacked savings. The stocks of companies, one of the goods being purchased, are sold for 50 times the price than what they are worth, and as a result, the Stock Market loses 12 times more money in 3 weeks than the US Government uses in a year.  

In addition, the supply of many industries, such as farmers, are overproducing and outpacing the demand of their products, leading to waste. Since the demand of their products is way lower than what they have, bosses lay off workers. (*Workers being laid off now have no source of income, further slowing the demand of supplies as they can't purchase what they need*) 
### What did America feel that it had to do to recover from the Great Depression?
America knew that it needed to gain money and create motivation to be able to support itself and keep standing for any longer. Projects such as [[The Washington Monument]], Public work programs like the [[New Deal]], and the [[The Hoover Dam|Hoover Dam]] are contributed to America's [[TGD Recovery|Recovery]].
### What was the “Dust Bowl” and what caused it?
In **1934**, multiple duststorms hit New York, 18,000 miles wide, carrying 3 tons of dust, for every American. The storms originated in Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and Kanas. The Top soil is 4 meters deep - dried up and was loose due to the 4 years of farmers. Static electricity build up between the Earth and the Dust, and as a result, it is lifted up and is further propelled by high altitude winds.
### What were the affects of the “Dust Bowl”?
On **April 13, 1935**, [[Louise Walter]] is living on the southern plains with her daughters - she has breathing problems, and 39 duststorms within 3 months have just passed. The biggest dustorm hits, going at 65 miles an hour, as it hit's Colorado, the temperature changes, and [[Louise Walter]]'s daughters gets devoured by the sudden onslaught of dust. She is rescued by her mom, but the house it falling apart; dust is seeping through the walls, windows, and cracks of the wood house. Cattle die, being cut open by the sand. Dust Pneumonia can kill people, lungs full of dust.

Automatic Street lights come on during the day.

By **1936**, 26 billion dollars a day are lost by farmers. 250,000 farmers are fleeing the dust. Black Sunday. 2/3 of "dustbowlers" stay.
### What major engineering project helped to save the southwest of America?
The construction of [[The Hoover Dam]].
### How did this project help the southwest and America? What states did it mainly benefit?
The water and hydroelectricity that the Dam generates off of it's *'a-million-and-a-half-gallon-a-second-power*' transforms the whole of the Southwest. Nevada, Arizona, California, still benefit from the hydroelectricity today. It's profit is directly responsible for the town of [[Las Vegas]].
### What was the name of the man responsible for building this great engineering marvel?
[[Frank Crowe]], otherwise known as [[Frank Crowe|Frank 'hurry up' Crowe]] for his efficiency.
### In what ways was this creation going to help America out of the Great Depression?
The Dam generates electricity, and power from the water. The electricity made can make money for the US. It's profit is directly responsible for the town of [[Las Vegas]], and around **1930**, 5,000 people live in [[Las Vegas]]. The city is seen as a relaxing, fun and games (Drinking and Gambling) haven for men. Wives of men say that they deserve the haven for the hard work they have done on the [[The Hoover Dam|Hoover Dam]].

In **present day**, over 37 million people come each year to party.
### What entertainment event lifted America's spirit during these troubling times? What was the name of America's hero in this event?
The Heavy Weight Championship, where American hero, [[Joe Louis]], was put up against what was seen as America's opponent - German fighter, [[Max Schmelling]].
### After all that has happened, what coming world controversy was responsible for giving America the final push out of the great Depression?
[[Joe Louis]] loses the fight to [[Max Schmelling]]. This was inspiration for Germany, and was a publicity dream for the Nazis. [[Adolf Hitler]] says 'their mistake was freeing their slaves'. A rematch is arranged. In Germany, Nazis expand their power. [[Joe Louis]] had a lot of Weight on his Shoulders. For the first time in America's history, it was symbolically represented by a black man.

75 thousand people watch the fight live, 7 million people tune in via radio, 100 million people tune in via tv. The fight is a battle of ideologies, it was representing a lot more. [[Max Schmelling]] represented everything America disliked.

[[Max Schmelling|Schmelling]] is knocked out and loses the fight in 124 seconds. His victory was was what America needed at the time.
### ==Explain== How did the U.S. Government react to the Great Depression? `PG 426`
**1932**, the [[New Deal]] was a massive package of economic and social programs established by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] to help Americans during [[TGD INDEX|The Great Depression]].

The [[New Deal]] allowed the federal government to take a more active role in managing the economy. New laws regulated the stock market and protected bank deposits. Government programs created jobs and gave aid to farmers. A new Social Security system provided pensions for the elderly and other benefits.

Unfortunately, The [[New Deal]] program failed to out right end [[TGD INDEX|The Great Depression]] as it was planned to due to the natural disaster that was the [[TGD Dustbowl]]. (*This is not to say that the [[New Deal]] didn't help, it did, but not exactly enough*)
