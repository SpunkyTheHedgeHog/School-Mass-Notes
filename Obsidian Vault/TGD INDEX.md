## Questions, Answers, and Summaries
### In what year did the Great Depression begin?
[[TGD INDEX|The Great Depression]] began in **1929** 
### What was said to be the cause of the Great Depression in America?

### What did America feel that it had to do to recover from the Great Depression?

### What was the “Dust Bowl” and what caused it?
In **1934**, multiple duststorms hit New York, 18,000 miles wide, carrying 3 tons of dust, for every American. The storms originated in Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and Kanas. The Top soil is 4 meters deep - dried up and was loose due to the 4 years of farmers. Static electricity build up between the Earth and the Dust, and as a result, it is lifted up and is further propelled by high altitude winds.
### What were the affects of the “Dust Bowl”?
On **April 13, 1935**, [[Louise Walter]] is living on the southern plains with her daughters - she has breathing problems, and 39 duststorms within 3 months have just passed. The biggest dustorm hits, going at 65 miles an hour, as it hit's Colorado, the temperature changes, and [[Louise Walter]]'s daughters gets devoured by the sudden onslaught of dust. She is rescued by her mom, but the house it falling apart; dust is seeping through the walls, windows, and cracks of the wood house. Cattle die, being cut open by the sand. Dust Pneumonia can kill people, lungs full of dust.

By **1936**, 26 billion dollars a day are lost by farmers. 250,000 farmers are fleeing the dust. Black Sunday. 2/3 of "dustbowlers" stay.
### What major engineering project helped to save the southwest of America?
In attempt to recover, America started to try it's best to help itself out and reclaim at least some of what it lost. After losing above 6 million dollars, the public funded a vast amount of building projects that were privately built, one of them included 1 million dollar, 4 year project that was [[The Hoover Dam]], built over the Colorado river.

[[The Hoover Dam]], named after [[Herbert Hoover]], represented America regaining it's balance, fortitude, ingenuity, and talent hard work. It was built by head engineer [[Frank Crowe]], who gained the nicknamed [[Frank Crowe|Frank 'hurry up' Crowe]] for their efficiency at building Dams. **By March 4th, 1931**, the government gives the go-ahead to start construction, allowing [[Frank Crowe|Mr. Crowe]] to have 2.5% of the Dam's profit. 

42,000 men flock to Colorado in attempt to secure a job, many using up all - if any - of their savings that they had left to travel. Unfortunately, [[Frank Crowe]] only accepts 12% (5,000) of the men; It was survival of the fittest, known as [[Social Darwinism]]. As an incentive to pursue, [[Frank Crowe]] receives a $3,000 find each day the project falls behind schedule. The workers had to endure rough conditions, such as 140 degree heat, and Carbon monoxide poisoning coming from the drills. [[Frank Crowe]] didn't exactly motivate the workers either, stating :

>"*To hell with excuses - get results*" - [[Frank Crowe]]

[[Erma Godbey]], a miner's wife, recites a story about a miner who was so anxious to work, that he went into the drill site to clear rubble, and was killed due to a delayed blast of dynamite that he was not aware of. It is estimated that hundreds of men died in the project, but the company only confirms 96.

The water and hydroelectricity that the Dam generates off of it's *'a-million-and-a-half-gallon-a-second-power*' will transform the whole of the Southwest. Nevada, Arizona, California, still benefit from the hydroelectricity today.
### How did this project help the southwest and America? What states did it mainly benefit?

### In what ways was this creation going to help America out of the Great Depression?

### What entertainment event lifted Americas spirit during these troubling times? What was the name of Americas hero in this event?

### After all that has happened what coming world controversy was responsible for giving America the final push out of the great Depression?
