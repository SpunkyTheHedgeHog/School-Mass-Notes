## Questions, Answers, and Summaries
### In what year did the Great Depression begin?
[[TGD INDEX|The Great Depression]] began in **1929** 
### What was said to be the cause of the Great Depression in America?

### What did America feel that it had to do to recover from the Great Depression?

### What was the “Dust Bowl” and what caused it?
In **1934**, multiple duststorms hit New York, 18,000 miles wide, carrying 3 tons of dust, for every American. The storms originated in Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and Kanas. The Top soil is 4 meters deep - dried up and was loose due to the 4 years of farmers. Static electricity build up between the Earth and the Dust, and as a result, it is lifted up and is further propelled by high altitude winds.
### What were the affects of the “Dust Bowl”?
On **April 13, 1935**, [[Louise Walter]] is living on the southern plains with her daughters - she has breathing problems, and 39 duststorms within 3 months have just passed. The biggest dustorm hits, going at 65 miles an hour, as it hit's Colorado, the temperature changes, and [[Louise Walter]]'s daughters gets devoured by the sudden onsluaght of dust. She is rescued by her mom, but the house it falling apart; dust is seeping through the walls, windows, and cracks of the wood house. Cattle die, being cut open by the sand. Dust Pneumonia can kill people, lungs full of dust.

By **1936**, 26 billion dollars a day are lost by farmers. 250,000 farmers are fleeing the dust. Black Sunday. 2/3 of "dustbowlers" stay.
### What major engineering project helped to save the southwest of America?
In attempt to recover, America started to try it's best help itself out and relaim at least some of what it lost. After losing above 6 million dollars, the public funded a vast amount of building projects that were privatly built, one of them included [[The Hoover Dam]], built over the Colorado river. [[The Hoover Dam]], named after [[Herbert Hoover]] represented America regaining it's balance. It was built by head engineer [[Frank Crowe]], nicknamed [[Frank Crowe|Frank 'hurry up' Crowe]] for their efficciecy at building Dams. 

Vast building projects - Publicly funded privately built

[[Frank Crowe|Frank 'hurry up' Crowe]] built a damn over the Colorado river, called [[The Hoover Dam]], named after [[Herbert Hoover]]

The water and hydroelectricity will transform the whole of the Southwest.
Nevada, Arizona, California, still benefit from the hydroelectricity today.

**March 4th, 1931** : The government gives the go-ahead to build [[The Hoover Dam]]

Even before it was built, it was seen as a metaphor

[[The Hoover Dam]] would cost 1 million dollars to build.
Frank would receive a 2.5% cut of the Dam's profit. 

42,000 men come across the country looking for jobs.

[[Frank Crowe]] takes 5,000 men out of the 42,000 people who spent 'maybe' the majority of their savings to travel.

It was survival of the fittest, known as [[Social Darwinism]]
