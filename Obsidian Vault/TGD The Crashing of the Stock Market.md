# The Crashing of the Stock Market

**1920**, it was the time of social upheaval, poverty, drought. Money is in circulation. Oil wells are generating lots of income, and skyscrapers rise high. There were many suburban housing projects, such as Hollywood-Land, and America was getting carried away with consumerism and capitalism.

**1929**, more money is spent on advertisement than education. The boom is built on easy credit - 6 billion dollars of goods are bought on credit and Money was being borrowed that people could not pay back (hurting both sides). 80% of Americans have no savings at all.

Some stocks are bought at 50 times of what they are worth. The [[Stock market]] loses 12 times more money in three weeks than the US government uses in a year. #Inquiry `How does the [[Stock Market]] lose money, isn't it always in circulation?`. Americans economy teeters on the edge of the abyss.
