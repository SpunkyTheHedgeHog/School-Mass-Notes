# Axis Powers

## DWP
### ==DESCRIBE== Describe how the Axis powers gained control of most of Europe in 1941. `PG 465`
The Axis Powers first acted out what was called Operation Sea Lion, a series of blitzes in which German Military Air Support bombed military bases and cities (like London) in Europe. While Opperation Sea Lion didn't out right bring Europe to it's knees - as what [[Adolf Hitler]] hoped; as people were still attempting to carry on with their standard routine, it assisted in the second plan of the Axis Powers.

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s "New Order" was the plan to put light-skinned Europeans (known as the Aryan Masterace) in the offices of puppet governments #Inquiry, and to achieve this plan, he [most likely] used military blitzkrieg tatics causing devestating impacts with tanks and air. The land that they gained provided valuable economic reasources and provided money to support [[Adolf Hitler]]'s vision.

To surpress any uprising of rebels, German officers and military would often boss around and torture anyone and everyone.
