# Axis Powers

## DWP
### ==DESCRIBE== Describe how the Axis powers gained control of most of Europe in 1941. `PG 465`
The Axis Powers first acted out what was called Operation Sea Lion, a series of blitzes in which German Military Air Support bombed military bases and cities (like London) in Europe. While Opperation Sea Lion didn't out right bring Europe to it's knees - as what [[Adolf Hitler]] hoped; as people were still attempting to carry on with their standard routine, it assisted in the second plan of the Axis Powers.

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s "New Order" was the plan to put light-skinned Europeans (known as the Aryan Masterace) in the offices of puppet governments #Inquiry, and to achieve this plan, he [most likely] used military blitzkrieg tatics causing devestating impacts with tanks and air. The land that they gained provided valuable economic reasources and provided money to support [[Adolf Hitler]]'s vision.

To surpress any uprising of rebels, German officers and military would often boss around and torture anyone and everyone.
### ==IDENTIFY SUPPORTING DETAILS== Why did Hitler nullify the Nazi-Soviet Pact by invading the Soviet Union `PG 466`
[[Adolf Hitler]] voided the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]], which was to keep peice between the Soviet-Union and Nazi-Germany - dividing up any land that they had conquered. He did so by attempting to take control of Leningrad and it' factories, reasources, and food. The effort was suffered due to the unaccounted for winter, in which many German soldeirs died of the starvation and the -18c tempature.
