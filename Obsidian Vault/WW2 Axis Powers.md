### ==DESCRIBE== Describe how the Axis powers gained control of most of Europe in 1941. `PG 465`
The Axis Powers first acted out what was called Operation Sea Lion, a series of blitzes in which German Military Air Support bombed military bases and cities (like London) in Europe. While Operation Sea Lion didn't out right bring Europe to it's knees - as what [[Adolf Hitler]] hoped; as people were still attempting to carry on with their standard routine, it assisted in the second plan of the Axis Powers.

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s "New Order" was the plan to put light-skinned Europeans (known as the Aryan Masterace) in the offices of puppet governments #Inquiry, and to achieve this plan, he [most likely] used military blitzkrieg tactics causing devastating impacts with tanks and air. The land that they gained provided valuable economic resources and provided money to support [[Adolf Hitler]]'s vision.

To suppress any uprising of rebels, German officers and military would often boss around and torture anyone and everyone.
### ==IDENTIFY SUPPORTING DETAILS== Why did Hitler nullify the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-Soviet Pact by invading the Soviet Union `PG 466`
[[Adolf Hitler]] voided the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]], which was to keep piece between the Soviet-Union and [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-Germany and dividing up any land that they had conquered. He did so by attempting to take control of Leningrad and it' factories, resources, and food. In addition to the reasources, he would also gain more living space for his "masterrace". The effort was suffered due to the unaccounted for winter, in which many German soldiers died of the starvation and the -18c temperature.
### ==ANALYZE MAPS== How might this new enemy affect Germanys war effort in geographical terms? `PG 466`
Germany created a new enemy, Russia, after violating the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-Soviet pact. This hurt Germany's defenses as they now needed to spread out their military across the areas under Axis control as well as North-East border between Russia's territory and German's.
### ==IDENTIFY CENTRAL IDEAS== Why did Japanese leaders view the United States as an enemy? `PG 467`
The Japanese leaders viewed the US as an enemey because The US cut them off from selling resources after Japan has been conquering areas.
