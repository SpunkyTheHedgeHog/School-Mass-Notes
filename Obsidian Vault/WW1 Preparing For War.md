# WW1 Preparing For War
In preparing for the war, America went from only 300 thousand men in their army to 4 million.

When The United States adopted the Draft, it opened up for Conscientious Objection, in which someone who is drafted tells the government that they cannot serve for religious or other reasons. 

65,000 men claimed conscientious objection, and for it they received bullying, physical violence, and in some cases prosecution. They were considered a danger to the War effort. Many could not get jobs and were being rejected.

Laws were made to make it illegal to criticize the government or the war effort. People who objected went to prison, received a record, and were released after the end of the War - but the consequences could last long after.
