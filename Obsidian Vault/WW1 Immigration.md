**1914**, America is at it's peak of Immigration.

[[Woodrow Wilson|President Woodrow Wilson]] urges Americans to avoid violently taking sides afraid that the different ethnicities will line up against each other. His goal is to create what he calls **[[100% Americanism]]**, which he hopes will be a key factor in winning the war.

Immigrant communities were diverse in their reaction to the war, some supported their home nations while others did not.

==German Immigrants were treated harshly== :
- They were considered aliens.
- Had to go down to police stations to get fingerprinted.
- Forced to carry an identification card.
- Were put under surveillance by the government.
- Banned from representing/expressing their culture.
- Could not teach the German Language in Schools.
- German newspapers were forced to cancel.
- Were tarred and feathered - by Mob groups.
- Forced to kiss Americans flags - by Mob groups.
- Their houses being painted yellow so that they could be easily identified and further harassed.

==1 In Every 5== soldiers in the US Armed Forces is an immigrant. Some immigrants thought that joining the Military was a path to citizenship. It was *believed* that bringing all the "Hyphenated Americans" together would make them all *just* Americans. Having immigrants in the Army was a mutual learning experience that created national unity.
