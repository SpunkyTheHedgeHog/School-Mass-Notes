# WW1 Native-Americans
In the **1920**s, Native-Americans had been confined to reservations. They had disease, destruction of their culture. There was a huge effort to 'educate' Indians but they did not want that. A program called the [[Allotment Act]] was tried :

When WW1 broke out, **thousands of Native-Americans volunteered to fight in Europe**. The Onondagas declared war on Germany themselves. Many Native-Americans wanted to fight for their homeland, Some wanted to demonstrate that they are equal to white people.

About 10,000 American Indians served in the Army, and about 2,000 served in the Navy.

One way that **Indians contributed to the war was their language**. Communication was frequently being intercepted, so they said their messages in Native-American's native language so the Germans could not understand.

Many Indians did not receive discrimination in the Army compared to back home, so when they came back, they protested for rights - and got them; They became citizens.
