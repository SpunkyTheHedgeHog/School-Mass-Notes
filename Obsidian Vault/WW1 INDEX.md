**What was America like before and during World War I?**
>America before the war was in a 'golden age', they were experiencing an optimistic future, and were trying to avoid war as much as possible. However, after the War, America was very different, there were many social changes and many people were distraught.
Before the war, America was peaceful; America had recovered from the civil war, the reconstruction era, and was coming into the civil rights era. The Allied Forces (France, Britain, Russia, America) were ending their Industrial Revolutions and gained the economic boost that came with it. It was the height of White Supremacy due to -.
After the War however, America changed. The government and hospitals were not prepared for the Soldiers coming home. The Soldiers came home to a country that had changed. The men who stayed home became richer and women became more independent, but the soldiers who came home were distraught and felt alone and forgotten. Some Soldiers came home with physical injuries, and or amputated limbs, obviously, they would not be hired. However, most soldiers came back with mental damage, PTSD - or at the time, known as Shell Shock - this damage could not be seen, and soldiers could not function enough to consistently do a job.

During the war, Women took on many jobs that were considered masculin (such as Typists, Telephone Operators (Signal Corp), Civilian Contractors), so when men came home, they did not expect women to be doing 'their' jobs, and were shocked. Women now were considered formal members of the Armed Services; Expectations of Women changed, Women gained respect and became more Independent. African-American soldiers were treated even worse with White Suppresists wanting to 'show them their place'.

This all is generating fear that Socialism might be coming to the United States, and leads to investigations, raids, and deportations of people who opposed the government or took radical positions. The average US citizen did not benefit from the War, only the government and the select few who were able to stay home, many citizens were at unrest. In all, America changed immensely, some changes for the better, like Women's roles, and Native-American rights, but other changes, like the experiences of the soldiers who came back home, for the worse.
