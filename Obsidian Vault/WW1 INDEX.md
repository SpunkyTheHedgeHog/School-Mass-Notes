## Questions, Answers, & Summaries
### **What was America like before and during World War I?**
America before the war was in a 'golden age', they were experiencing an optimistic future, and were trying to avoid war as much as possible. However, during the war, America had to adjust and compensate for the situation. There were many social changes that were brought on.

[[WW1 Life Before The War|Before the war]], America was peaceful; America had recovered from the civil war, the reconstruction era, and was coming into the civil rights era. The [[Industrial Revolution]] allowed America to gain an economic boost and thus America enjoyed a long period of peace. Yet, it was the height of [[White Supremacy]] because America was changing socially - African American people were finding opportunities to work, but many White Supremacists did not want this shift in social structure.

At the start of the war, America saw the war as a business opportunity. Because of the [[Industrial Revolution]], we had factories and workers, and because we had factories and workers, we could provide a surplus of supplies to Europe throughout the War.

[[WW1 Life During The War|During the War]], America had to crack down on many aspects of itself, such as peoples' lack of motivation. In efforts to get the United States as a whole to be more united (*see what I did there?*), [[Woodrow Wilson|President Woodrow Wilson]], used what he called [[100% Americanism]], which was the concept that [[WW1 Immigration|American Immigrants]] must "renounce any sort of ties to their homelands; political ties, cultural ties, economic ties to be considered 100% loyal." i.e. 100% National Unity. [[Militarism]] (Glorification of the Military) was a key part in getting people motivated for the War and keeping morale high. Instances of Militarism such as making people feel like losers for not joining the Military and flexing of weaponry contributed to the all around war effort.

Immigrant communities were diverse in their reaction to the war, some supported their home nations while others did not. German Immigrants were treated cruelly whether they supported Germany or not. As a list of atrocities that they had to deal with, German Immigrants : 

-   Were considered aliens.
-   Had to go down to police stations to get fingerprinted.
-   Forced to carry an identification card.
-   Were put under surveillance by the government.
-   Banned from representing/expressing their culture.
-   Could not teach the German Language in Schools.
-   German newspapers were forced to cancel.
-   Were tarred and feathered - by Mob groups.
-   Forced to kiss American flags - by Mob groups.

To make harassing them easier, Americans painted/tagged their houses in yellow so that they were easy to identify and pick out - target. Yellow is a bright color.

Throughout the war, The government encouraged the people at home to help to the best of their abilities, ordering/suggesting that citizens use less meat and wheat, and instead use ingredients like fish, beans, and corn. In preparing for the war, America went from only 300 thousand men in their army to 4 million. When The United States adopted the Draft, it opened up for Conscientious Objection, in which someone who is drafted tells the government that they cannot serve for religious or other reasons. 65,000 men claimed conscientious objection, and for it they received bullying, physical violence, and in some cases prosecution. They were considered a danger to the War effort. Many could not get jobs and were being rejected. Laws were made to make it illegal to criticize the government or the war effort, and people who objected went to prison, received a record, and were released after the end of the War - but the consequences could last long after.

When the majority of men left to go to the war, Women had to fill the jobs left behind. As a result, Women realized that they could do the jobs that were considered masculine. This led to a shift in Gender roles and the social structure of America. Many middle-class women became nurses, helped make supplies, volunteered (unpaid labor) to do jobs, and or became part of the [[WW1 YMCA|YMCA]].

In all, America seemed to have a bright horizon before the war, but when the war came, America's sights had to switch to focus on the war, and as a result of that, America had to motivate its people, and bring them together. In addition, Immigrants, African Americans, and Women were all treated differently during the War.
### **What Changes happened in America from the time soldiers left to WWI to the time period of and during their return?**
America pre-war was experiencing great prosperity, and were confident in their ability to participate in the war and remain unscathed. However, by the time the soldiers came back home, America was very different, and they had to accept the many social changes that took place while they were gone - many people were left distraught as a result.

After the War, The government and hospitals were not prepared for the Soldiers coming home - soldiers got hardly any help. The Soldiers came home to a country that had changed. The men who stayed home became richer and women became more independent, but the soldiers who came home were distraught and felt alone and forgotten. Some Soldiers came home with physical injuries, and or amputated limbs, obviously, they would not be hired. However, most soldiers came back with mental damage, PTSD - or at the time, known as Shell Shock - this damage could not be seen, and soldiers could not function enough to consistently do a job. Soldiers with *issues* were neglected. The Thousand Yard, is a tell tale sign of a soldier who has been detached from the world - staring into nothing. 

Women's roles changed drastically. During the war, Women took on many jobs that were considered masculine (such as Typists, Telephone Operators (Signal Corp), Civilian Contractors), so when men came home, they did not expect women to be doing 'their' jobs, and were shocked. Women now were considered formal members of the Armed Services; Expectations of Women changed, Women gained respect and became more Independent. Many of these shifts in roles would be considered taboo and unheard of pre-war.

Before the War, Native-Americans were confined to reservations. Native-Americans had recently experienced diseases and the destruction of their culture. After the War however, for their contributions, Native-Americans protested and received rights, becoming citizens.

America's economy is in trouble, there was a revolution in Russia that is bringing a Socialist government to power. Ideas about Socialism are spreading throughout Europe. This all is generating fear that Socialism might be coming to the United States, and leads to investigations, raids, and deportations of people who opposed the government or took radical positions. The average US citizen did not benefit from the War, only the government, high ranking government officials, and the select few who were able to stay home, many citizens were at unrest. 

In sum everything up, America changed immensely from the time of the war to the end, some changes for the better, like Women's roles, and Native-American rights, but other changes, like the experiences of the soldiers who came back home, for the worse.
### **Give a brief summary of the experiences of each of these African American groups during World War I:**
#### African American Women :
While non-African American Women had many opportunities, African American Women did not get the same chances and were instead prohibited from many jobs. African American Women could not be nurses, or work in the YMCAs abroad. Only 2 African American Women were allowed to use their nursing profession in Europe. Instead of being allowed to help, the most that they could do is contribute their money, in the form of [[War Bonds]], in which they raised an estimate of $250 million of.
#### African American Soldiers that fought in American Units :
African American Soldiers that were drafted into the army were treated with heavy discrimination. The generals gave labor intensive jobs to African-Americans, many in dangerous situations. In addition, they did not have any protection in these situations - in which many were close to enemy lines. One of the worst jobs was the Graves Registration Service, in which men had to disinter the bodies of the fallen soldiers.

Even after being awarded Distinguished service Crosses, African American Units received hate from White southern officers - being slandered as "rapists, malcontents, and incompetent black officers".
#### African American Soldiers that fought in French Units :
When some African American Soldiers were transferred to the French Army were treated with much more respect and based off of their work ethic. The Harlem Hell fighters were a highly honorable African American infantry unit that spent the most time in combat than that of any other unit. 

Unfortunately, When they came back to America, America did not honor their efforts, did not give them the medals that they earned/deserved, and made up lies saying that they were rapists and did not follow orders ([[White Supremacy]] was at an all time high).
#### African Americans as a people during the World War 1 Time period :
At the time of entering the War, African-Americans were largely living in rural areas. Slavery has ended but [[Jim Crow]], a form of discrimination and racial segregation, has replaced it. Everyone is asked to conserve food, buy bonds, and support the war effort, African-Americans raised an estimate of $250 million in [[war bonds]]. After the War, African-American soldiers were treated even worse with White Supremacists wanting to 'show them their place'. There were many massacres against black people throughout the war as it was the height of [[White Supremacy]], one of the massacres being called the 'Red Summer' of 1919. [[W.E.B Du Bois]], goes to Europe to interview African-American troops, and learns a lot; He declares

>“We Return from Fighting. We Return Fighting”
### **Explain what difficulties average citizens went through in America during WWI.**
While many Americans went to war, citizens back home had to deal with their own set of problems. The average US citizen did not benefit from the War, only the government, high ranking government officials, and the select few men who were able to stay home and profit, many citizens were at unrest. The men who did stay home were faced with constant bullying by others for being unhonorable, and unpatriotic.

Out of all the citizens, German Immigrants were treated the worst. Whether they supported Germany or not, they experienced constant abuse. German Immigrants were considered aliens, had to go down to police stations to get fingerprinted, forced to carry an identification card, and were put under surveillance by the government. They were banned from representing / expressing their culture, and could not teach the German Language in Schools; German newspapers were forced to cancel. They were harassed, tarred and feathered, and forced to kiss American flags by Mob groups. To make harassing them easier, Americans painted/tagged their houses in yellow so that they were easy to identify and pick out - target. Yellow is a bright color.
### **What changes happened for and in women as a result of and during WWI?**
Women's roles changed drastically. During the war, Women took on many jobs that were considered masculine (such as Typists, Telephone Operators (Signal Corp), Civilian Contractors), so when men came home, they did not expect women to be doing 'their' jobs, and were shocked. Women now were considered formal members of the Armed Services; Expectations of Women changed, Women gained respect and became more Independent. Many of these shifts in roles would be considered taboo and unheard of pre-war. This was the height of time for the change of Gender Roles, something that we are still experiencing today. Because of WW1, **the rate of change was accelerated.**
### **What were the experiences of Native American people in America and in the War during WWI?**
Before the War, Native-Americans were confined to reservations. Native-Americans had recently experienced diseases and the destruction of their culture. There was a huge effort to 'educate' Indians but they did not want that. A program called the [[Allotment Act]] was tried. The [[Allotment Act]] tried to divide up Indian reservations and give each Indian family their own piece of property, hastening their introduction into white society. By taking an allotment, they would become a citizen, meaning that they could be drafted.

When WW1 broke out, thousands of Native-Americans volunteered to fight in Europe. The Onondagas declared war on Germany themselves. Many Native-Americans wanted to fight for their homeland, Some wanted to demonstrate that they are equal to white people. About 10,000 American Indians served in the Army, and about 2,000 served in the Navy. One way that Indians contributed to the war was their language. Communication was frequently being intercepted, so they said their messages in Native-American's native language so the Germans could not understand.

Many Indians did not receive discrimination in the Army compared to back home, so when they came back, they protested for rights - and got them; They became citizens.
### **Who benefited from the War?**
The average citizen did not benefit from the war at all, the only people that benefited from the war was high-ranking government officials.
### **Why were German Immigrant Houses Painted Yellow?**
German Immigrants were treated harshly in America, constantly being harassed. To make harassing them easier, Americans painted/tagged their houses in yellow so that they were easy to identify and pick out - target. Yellow is a bright color.
