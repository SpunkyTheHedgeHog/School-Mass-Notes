### **What was America like before and during World War I?**
America before the war was in a 'golden age', they were experiencing an optimistic future, and were trying to avoid war as much as possible. However, during the war, America had to adjust and compensate for the situation. There were many social changes that were brought on.

[[WW1 Life Before The War|Before the war]], America was peaceful; America had recovered from the civil war, the reconstruction era, and was coming into the civil rights era. The [[WW1 Allied Powers|Allied Forces]] (France, Britain, Russia, America) were ending their [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Revolutions]] and gained the economic boost that came with it (plus [[Imperialism]]). It was the height of [[White Supremacy]] due to -.

[[WW1 Life During The War|During the War]], America had to crack down on many aspects of it's self, such as peoples' lack of motivation. In efforts to get the United States as a whole to be more united `(see what I did there?)`, [[Woodrow Wilson|President Woodrow Wilson]],  used what he called [[100% Americanism]], which was the concept that [[WW1 Immigration|American Immigrants]] must "renounce any sort of ties to their homelands; political ties, cultural ties, economic ties to be considered 100% loyal." i.e. 100% National Unity. [[Militarism]] (Glorification of the Military) was a key part in getting people motivated for the War and keeping moral high. Instances of Militarism such as making people feel like losers for not joining the Military and flexing of weaponry contributed to the War.

America, also in means of supporting the War effort, 

In [[WW1 Preparing For War|preparing for the war]], America went from only 300 thousand men in their army to 4 million. When The United States adopted the Draft, it opened up for Conscientious Objection, in which someone who is drafted tells the government that they cannot serve for religious or other reasons. 65,000 men claimed conscientious objection, and for it they received bullying, physical violence, and in some cases prosecution. They were considered a danger to the War effort. Many could not get jobs and were being rejected. Laws were made to make it illegal to criticize the government or the war effort. People who objected went to prison, received a record, and were released after the end of the War - but the consequences could last long after.

### **What Changes happened in America from the time soldiers left to WWI to the time period of and during their return?**
America before the war was in a 'golden age', they were experiencing an optimistic future, and were trying to avoid war as much as possible. However, at the time the soldiers came back home, America was very different, there were many social changes and many people were left in distraught.

[[WW1 Women's Roles|Women's roles]] changed drastically. During the war, Women took on many jobs that were considered masculine (such as Typists, Telephone Operators (Signal Corp), Civilian Contractors), so when men came home, they did not expect women to be doing 'their' jobs, and were shocked. Women now were considered formal members of the Armed Services; Expectations of Women changed, Women gained respect and became more Independent. Many of these shifts in roles would be considered taboo and unheard of pre-war. 

[[WW1 Life After The War|After the War]], The government and hospitals were not prepared for the Soldiers coming home - soldiers got hardly any help. The Soldiers came home to a country that had changed. The men who stayed home became richer and women became more independent, but the soldiers who came home were distraught and felt alone and forgotten. Some Soldiers came home with physical injuries, and or amputated limbs, obviously, they would not be hired.. However, most soldiers came back with mental damage, PTSD - or at the time, known as Shell Shock - this damage could not be seen, and soldiers could not function enough to consistently do a job. Soldiers with *issues* were neglected. The Thousand Yard, is a tell tale sign of a soldier who has been detached from the world - staring into nothing. 

(Paragraph about Native Americans)

America's economy is in trouble, there was a revolution in Russia that is bringing a Socialist government to power. Ideas about Socialism are spreading throughout Europe. This all is generating fear that Socialism might be coming to the United States, and leads to investigations, raids, and deportations of people who opposed the government or took radical positions. The average US citizen did not benefit from the War, only the government and the select few who were able to stay home, many citizens were at unrest. 

In all, America changed immensely from the time of the war to the end, some changes for the better, like Women's roles, and Native-American rights, but other changes, like the experiences of the soldiers who came back home, for the worse.

When they came back, America did not honor those medals and made up lies saying that they were rapists and did not follow orders ([[White Supremacy]] was at an all time high).

#### African Americans as a people during the World War 1 Time period :
At the time of entering the War, African-Americans are largely living in rural areas. Slavery has ended but [[Jim Crow]], a form of discrimination and racial segregation, has replaced it. Everyone is asked to conserve food, buy bonds, and support the war effort, **African-Americans raised an estimate of $250 million in [[war bonds]]**. There are many massacres against black people as it was the height of [[White Supremacy]], one of the massacres being called the '[[WW1 Red Summer|Red Summer]]' of **1919**.
