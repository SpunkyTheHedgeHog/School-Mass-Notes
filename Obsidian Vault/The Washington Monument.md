# The Washington Monument
A monument is made to symbolize America's Tenacity, it was a symbol of America's fate in it's future, as well as it's past. The Washington Monument is made, blasted out of rock. The rock is carved by drills and  - Hell for [[Bill Reynolds]], a driller. [[Bill Reynolds]] stays above the dynamite, grappled down over the edge. Lighting strikes the power line and causes the dynamite to go off prematurely, inuring and damaging [[Bill Reynolds]]'s eardrums, but he goes to work the next day anyway.

30,000 years will it take for the mountain to be shaped back to how it was from natural decay.

public works programs called the [[New Deal]], put in place by [[Franklin Roosevelt]].
