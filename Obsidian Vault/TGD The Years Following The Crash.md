# The Years following the Crash

**1929**, more money is spent on advertisement than education. The boom is built on easy credit - 6 billion dollars of goods are bought on credit and Money was being borrowed that people could not pay back (hurting both sides). 80% of Americans have no savings at all.

Some stocks are bought at 50 times of what they are worth. The [[Stock market]] loses 12 times more money in three weeks than the US government uses in a year. #Inquiry `How does the [[Stock Market]] lose money, isn't it always in circulation?`. Americans economy teeters on the edge of the abyss.

It has been a year since the crash, and a (unnamed) a person attempts to withdraw their money, anticipating a crash of the banks, but the bank refuses to give him his money #Inquiry `Did they refuse to give him his money?`. As a result 20,000 to 25,000 people gather outside the bank, attempting to withdraw their money and protesting. Police are sent to 'control' the problem. Banks are forced to close on a mass scale, and 28 states are left without have a single bank open. The federal government does not bail out the banks either.

1,000 homes are reposed everyday. 200,000 vagrant (people committing crimes) children wander the country - without parents. 34 million Americans have no source of Income.

2 million dollars are withdrawn from this branch alone
4 million to 12 million in **1932** #Inquiry  `4 million to 12 million what?`
