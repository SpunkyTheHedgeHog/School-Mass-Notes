# The Years following the Crash
It has been a year since the crash, 2% of people still own stocks, while the other 98% carry on.

A (unnamed) a person in [[Bronx]]  asks to withdraw their money/stocks from the "Bank of United Sates", anticipating a crash of the banks world wide. The Bank, while Reluctant to give him his shares/stocks, compile. However, the man then spreads around rumors that the bank did not give him his stock. As a result of the not only newspapers, but of the man's false claim, 20,000 to 25,000 people gather outside the bank, attempting to withdraw their money and protesting. Police are sent to 'control' the problem. 

The people of America withdraw 2 million dollars from their banks for safe caution within a single morning. In the final 60 days of **1930**, 600 banks shut. Banks are forced to close on a mass scale, and 28 states are left without have a single bank open. The federal government does not bail out the banks either. 

**1932**, Unemployment goes from 4 million to 12 million. 1,000 homes are reposed everyday. 200,000 vagrant (people committing crimes) children wander the country - without parents. 34 million Americans have no source of Income.
