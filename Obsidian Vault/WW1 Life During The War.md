# WW1 Life During The War
[[Militarism]] was a key part in getting people motivated for the War and keeping moral high. Instances of Militarism such as making people feel like losers for not joining the Military and flexing of Weaponry all contributed to the War.

America stayed nuetrual to the War, and engaged in trade with Europe. (This later caused Britian and other countries to be in dept)

America was considering joining the war because Germany sunk the Lousitaina (a trade ship). Germany was sinking out ships because America was bringing supplies to the Allied forces. While America did warn Germany to stop sinking their ships, Germany decided it would be a better option to stop the trade.
