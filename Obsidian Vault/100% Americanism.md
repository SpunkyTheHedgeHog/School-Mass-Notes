# 100% Americanism
**100% Americanism** was the notion that immigrants had to renounce any sort of ties to their homelands; political ties, cultural ties, economic ties to be considered 100% loyal.

The idea was to create a **collective American identity** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americanism_(ideology))

People changed the name of Hamburgers to Liberty Sandwiches.
